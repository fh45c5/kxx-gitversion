 libertarian_possibilism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Possibilist Libertarianism)§!\n\n Possibilist Libertarianism, also referred to as Treintismo and Possibilismo by its supporters, is a relatively young Spanish evolution of the more mainline anarcho-syndicalism followed by Spanish anarchists of the CNT-FAI. It began life when Ángel Pestaña, alongside 29 other anarchists of the CNT-FAI, published a so called Manifest of the Thirty, which harshly criticized the actions of the CNT-FAI and its radical leaders, such as Buanaventura Durruti. This manifesto would eventually lead to a splitting of the anarchist movement, and Ángel Pestaña’s wing first implemented ideas of possibilist libertarianism in action. Possibilist libertarianism aims to legitimize anarcho-syndicalist ideas in a non-revolutionary way, seeking to implement their policies through the framework of a liberal democracy, usually in a wide popular front with other socialist, syndicalist and social democratic parties. While the eventual aims of the possibilist libertarians remain largely the same as those of their more radical comrades, such as the abolishment or heavy decentralization of the Spanish state and abandoning capitalism in favour of syndicalist principles, worker’s co-operation and communal decision making, it is considerably more moderate in its actions and doesn’t see trade unions as the main nucleus of anarcho-syndicalist action. Due to Pestaña’s experiences during the Russian civil war, Possibilist libertarianism is highly anti-authoritarian, opposing both left and right-wing forms of totalitarianism vehemently. While the ideology is mostly limited to the Partido Sindicalista formed by Pestaña and his close ally Benito Pabón, it also had some sway within CNT-FAI through anarchist Horacio Martínez Prieto, and in some ways, among the ranks of Federación Sindicalista Libertaria."

 left_carlism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Carlism)§!\n\n Left Carlism or Social Carlism is an unique form of Carlism that developed after the movement drifted further from its traditionalist roots after a long period of stagnancy. Leaving the autocratic and ultraconservative roots of Carlism behind, the Left Carlist ideas came from the youth section of the movement in the 1950s, which adopted a form of self-management socialism, aimed at creating the first truly democratic Carlist organization which would become a mass party merging socialism and monarchism. Still committed to regional and local autonomy, though now through a lens of socialist decentralization, Left Carlists enjoy great popularity among Spain’s minority, especially Basques and Catalans. Despite its left-wing economical ideals, the movement still remains largely Christian in origin, and elements from more traditional Carlism can still be seen in Left Carlism’s rejection of modern liberal principles in favour of Catholic personalism and Christian democracy. While the movement has struggled to attain legitimacy due to various splits between more nationalist-leaning and more socialist-leaning factions, it continues to progress and evolve from the monarchist and neo-feudalist beginnings of Carlism into a truly democratic and populist organization."

Blasquismo is, at its roots, a populist ideology with a Spanish republican lean, with its core tenets being those of relentless grassroots activism, protection of Valencian culture and occasionally, violence against political opponents. Blasquist activism was organized primarily in various casinos located in the city of Valencia and in the newspaper articles written by Blasco Ibáñez. This led to the movement’s demonstrations being more sporadic and improvised than those of their fellow liberal republicans, but also netted them a far larger working class support than was typical to Spanish centrist parties.

Blasquist movement underwent a period of civil war as Blasco Ibáñez and his party rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed over leadership, leading to bloody clashes between their supporters. This exemplifies best the difference between Blasquismo and other Spanish centrist Republicans, the grassroots nature and closeness to Valencian people has in the past cause the movement to inspire great fanaticism and party tribalism in its supporters. As can be expected, Blasquismo is heavily tied to the ideology of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals, as the main Blasquist party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista, was a close ally of Partido Radical.

 marlib_lerrouxismo_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Lerrouxismo)§!\n\nLerrouxismo, as this ideology is often called by its many enemies, is a uniquely Spanish mix of Radical and Jacobin ideas, populist principles of mass mobilization and a near-personality cult like following around its inventor, Alejandro Lerroux.  While Lerroux’s and his party’s, Partido Radical Republicano’s, political positions have shifted dramatically during the era of the Second Spanish Republic and the military regime that followed it, Lerrouxismo at its core remains largely the same. Made up of fiery anti-clerical rhetoric, staunch resistance to Catalan separatism and heavy-handed tactics against its many enemies, Lerroux and his followers are willing to use violence, bribery and criminal means to achieve their aims. During the Primo de Rivera dictatorship, Lerrouxists were also involved in assassination attempts aimed at the king Alfonso XIII, sometimes even uncharacteristically in alliance with the anarchists of Catalonia. Contrary to the typical centrist party support base made up of middle class and intelligentsia, Lerrouxismo relies very heavily on workers, especially from Catalonian industrial areas, where Lerroux has utilized immigrant resentment towards native Catalans to drum up support for his radicals.\n\n These supporters, which Lerroux tended to call “young barbarians”, were encouraged to use radical means in order to tear down the control of the church and conservative institutions present in Spain at the time. The populist means used by Lerrouxists are also enhanced in part by the control the party holds over worker entertainment centres, such as the street of Paralelo in Barcelona. This has in the past allowed Lerrouxists to remain close to the grassroots militants of the party, as well as organized crime involved in gambling. Lerroux’s demagoguery and ideological flexibility has allowed this ideology to thrive despite the various twists and turns the Spanish politics have taken, but it may not always lead to the best results given the scandalous reputation the party has forged for itself."

Conservative, nationalists and easily adaptable to both republican and monarchist systems of Spain, it began its relevancy in 1913 following a split in the Spanish Conservative Party. Maurism developed naturally as an alternative to the canovismo era, establishing itself as a regeneration of the conservative movement, willing to even engage in street brawls to further its causes.

Regenerationism of Spanish empire was also an important part of the ideology, and it occasionally took ideas from Charles Maurras’ Action Francaise. Maurism was never officially endorsed by Antonio Maura himself, and due to this rather loose association of Maurists, the movement developed into different strands, each associating with one another but differing rather significantly in political programs.\n\n Gabriel Maura led a more liberal wing of the Maurists, Ángel Ossorio y Gallardo focused on the social Catholic wing of the movement while Antonio Goicoechea was perhaps the most radical Maurist, advocating for an “organic democracy”, anti-liberal and at times monarchist Spain.

 pataut_synarchism_subtype:0 "共治主义"
 pataut_synarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Synarchism)§!\n\nFormulated as a reaction to the Mexican Revolution and the increasingly Leftist policies of Zapata’s regime, Sinarquismo - or Mexican Synarchism - is the brainchild of José Antonio Urquiza and Salvador Abascal, alongside other thinkers such as Urquiza’s brother Carlos and the movement’s leading ideologues - the brothers Jose and Alfonso Truebas Olivares, as outlined in the movement’s self-published ‘Sinarquista Manifesto’; though it also holds some superficial similarities with a different concept also called Synarchism penned by the French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves as an opposite to anarchism, and also shares a name with Thomas Stackhouses’ ‘synarchy’ which means joint/harmonious rule. Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies. Also holding tangential links to similar movements across the Catholic Right in places like Austria and Iberia through a shared adherence to the ‘Rerum novarum’ of Pope Leo XIII, Sinarquismo is the Mexican Right’s last chance to fully turn back the clock to a pious time before the Mexican Revolution."

 iberian_federalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Integral Federalism)§!\n\nFederalist ideas in Spain and wider Iberia go back to the late 1700s, but the only real project for a truly federalized Spain appeared during the 1870s, during the short-lived First Spanish Republic. Given the immense variety of Spanish conditions within the boundaries of its international borders, with some areas like the Basque Country or Catalonia having a very distinct cultures and languages, the idea of federalism has been raised multiple times to create a nation that could unite these disparate groups while still supporting or tolerating their unique nature.  During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\n The Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

 liberating_nationalism_subtype:0 "活力主义"
 liberating_nationalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Vibrantism)§!\n\nVibrantism, or Liberating Nationalism, is the personal ideology of Catalan nationalist, Daniel Cardona i Civit, known locally by the nicknames Vibrant and the Irishman, and his party, Nosaltres Sols. Vibrantism as an ideology espouses a form of Catalanism, that is, Catalan nationalist and cultural movement, where the separation of Catalonia from Spain and Hispanishness in all its forms, be they monarchist, autocratic or republican, is the most important aim. The ideology is heavily influenced by Cardona’s own experiences within the Catalan nationalist movements, as during his collaboration with parties such as Estat Catala, he was often expelled for advocating for complete separation from Spain after more pragmatic actors accepted offers from Madrid for a more autonomist solutions.\n\n Vibrantism is also inherently liberal and democratic, despite its militant and nationalist roots, as Cardona saw ideologies such as Totalism and Legionarism as the state imposing itself on the individual, whereas he saw his own nationalist thoughtform as the individual imposing themselves on the state. According to Cardona, nationalism is inherently social, not political, and it respects and preserves the being of the individual, the family, the municipality, the region and the nation. To him, nationalism is the preservation of the spiritual and human content of every social element. Vibrantism is also quite fluid in its support, as it tends to aim for an apolitical, trans-classist approach, seeking support from working-class nationalists as well, evident in Nosaltres Sols’ alliance with Partit Catala Proletari. Cardona considers nationalism to be an evolutionary trait of peoples, and thus incapable of being truly crushed even in the face of imperialism or disruptive ideologies of the day. This, at times paradoxical ideology, is slowly becoming more mainstream in Catalan politics after the inclusion of Nosaltres Sols in parliamentary politics, and it may very well see new evolutions to its base formula now that separation from Spain has been achieved."
