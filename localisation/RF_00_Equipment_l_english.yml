 CZE_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Great War erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

The KP/-41 itself began as a derivative of Lahti's own 'Suomi' submachine gun rechambered for his new cartridge, and indeed, while retention of the general shape and feel of the KP/-31 was prefered, ultimately, the new design's massive recoil impetus led to both further external changes to the weapon's body as well as a reduction in its cyclic rate."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

Liberia acquired its Krags as highly discounted military assistance from the United States shortly after the fall of France in Europe, thanks largely to American fears of Nationalist French invasion of the country."

The standardisation of all Mausers in Ottoman inventory helped ease the logistical nightmare of having to supply 4 different types of rifle ammunition to all units. As a client state of the Ottoman Empire, Tripolitania also began to slowly adopt the M38 and standardize around the 8x57mm rifle cartidge."

 SLO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Great War. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Great War refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short \"Stutzen\" (\"cut-down\") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Great War erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Great War refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short \"Stutzen\" (\"cut-down\") configuration."

In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

 ASC_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Great War. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Great War refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short \"Stutzen\" (\"cut-down\") configuration."
 ASC_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Mannlicher-FÉG Karabiner M.24"
 ASC_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Kar M.24"
 ASC_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Great War made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

 ASC_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "SlKar M.42"
 ASC_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Great War erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."
 ASC_infantry_equipment_3:0 "ZB Maschinenkarabiner M.44"
 ASC_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "MKar M.44"
 ASC_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of \"heavy\" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

The Saurer R77 artillery tractor was one of the first of such converstions and was relatively simple: An armoured \"box\" was added to the chasis that protected the driver and personnel inside. The deployment of these conversions helped cement the concept of armoured transports in Austrian doctrine."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

 MOL_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Great War. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for \"back and forth\") by Austrian troops and \"Ta-Pum\" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song \"Ta pum!\" from the Great War refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short \"Stutzen\" (\"cut-down\") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm \"Spitzer\" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Great War erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

They proved to be superior to the TPz38/40 in every way with stronger armour and a better engine."

Originally designed for bold stormtroopers breaking the stalemate of the Western Front, our trials have found the short-range rapid-fire power of this weapon to be equally well suited for speculative or reflexive firing in the shadow-speckled chaos of jungle warfare. Firing the same 9mm parabellum cartridge which the original German machine tooling was configured for, the lightweight ammunition of the weapon provides high performance at all practical ranges."
