 ADL.20.t:0 "Abd el-Krim’s Ideological Turn"
 ADL.20.d:0 "With the victory over Spanish now clear, the ADLian republic can finally breathe free, saved from the colonialist tendencies of the Europeans by the brave hands of the Harakas and rough tribal warriors of the Atlas mountains. However, without the inspiring leadership of Abd el-Krim, this victory could have hardly been a reality, and the ADLian people owe their thanks to him.\n\n Nonetheless, as the guns fall silent and the time of war ends, ADL enters unknown waters as Abd El-Krim must stay true to his word and shift the regime of the Republic to a democratic, representative constitutional republic. Back during the first ADL war, the ADL government was largely made up of youthful modernizers, but due to the terrible losses of that war, during the new revolt against Spain, the regime had to rely on traditionalist tribal structures more than before. As such, Abd el-Krim moderated his rhetoric towards a more conservative and paternalistic outlook, which earned us the support of the more stubborn and anti-modernist tribes. However, the modernist clique within ADL government has demanded that the president adopts more progressive policies to truly live up to the dreams of the original ADL Republic. ADL’s syndicalist allies in the Commune have also urged el-Krim to adopt a more left-leaning tinge to his movement, though this would obviously annoy other allies in the Moroccan nobility."
