 POLITICS_ALPHONSO_BOURBON_DESC:0 "阿方索十三世·波旁家族成员，自1886年出生起即为国王，1932年在民众普遍蔑视中复位西班牙王位。他的第二次统治比第一次更加动荡不安；共和主义者、卡洛斯主义者和社会主义者都在削弱他的权威，而经济增长也陷入停滞。在阿方索的统治下，西班牙已成为随时可能爆发的火药桶。"
 POLITICS_JUAN_BOURBON_DESC:0 "胡安·波旁继承了一个分裂的西班牙，一个处于深渊边缘的西班牙。作为备受厌恶的阿方索的儿子和继承人，他的统治将永远笼罩在父亲的阴影之下。但必须带领西班牙走向更美好未来的，是胡安，而不是阿方索。"
 POLITICS_FRANSISCO_FRANCO_DESC:0 "弗朗西斯科·佛朗哥·巴阿蒙德将军以其广为人知的魅力和独特的西班牙式男子气概迅速崛起，成为人民行动党的领袖。如今，作为西班牙国家元首的佛朗哥，肩负着重塑这个破碎国家的艰巨任务。对于这一重任，无人能否认他具有独特的资格去承担。"
 POLITICS_MIGUEL_FERRER_DESC:0 "米格尔·卡瓦内利斯·费雷尔在里夫战争中指挥西班牙的非洲殖民地征召兵，通过严格的纪律和专注在西班牙政坛崭露头角。他所领导的西班牙长枪党，与其说是传统的政党，不如说更像是准军事组织，可能是唯一有能力为西班牙带来某种秩序的力量。"
 POLITICS_GIL_ROBLES_QUINONES_DESC:0 "何塞·马利亚·吉尔-罗伯斯是一位坚定的君主主义者和激进的天主教徒，在西班牙崛起。他充满激情的演讲，一方面谴责王国的敌人，另一方面颂扬宗教美德，甚至可能让卡洛斯主义者都觉得激进。然而，基尼奥内斯依然坚定地站在这个动荡不安的西班牙国家的前列。"
 POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_DESC:0 "海梅·波旁，阿方索十三世的次子，自幼失聪，曾被认为可能会放弃对王位的任何觊觎，如今已登上西班牙王位，成为新任国王。尽管他心智健全，但身为残疾人的名声却已先他而传。然而，这位出人意料的君主现在必须引领西班牙走向充满未知的未来。"
 POLITICS_JAIME_BOURBON_FRANCE_DESC:0 "海梅·波旁，阿方索十三世的次子，他身患耳疾，曾一度被普遍认为会放弃对王位的任何要求，然而他却成就了看似不可能的事情，被加冕为西班牙和法国两国的国王。作为西班牙的统治者，他以海梅一世的名号进行统治，而在法国，他则采用了亨利六世这一王者之名。不过，在日常交谈中，许多人亲切地简称他为雅克·亨利国王，将他的西班牙和法国王者身份融合为一个令人难忘的称呼。"
 POLITICS_CARLOS_PIO_DESC:0 "奥地利的卡尔·皮乌斯大公，匈牙利和波希米亚王太子，托斯卡纳亲王，现在被称为西班牙国王卡洛斯八世。在整整两个世纪后，哈布斯堡家族终于再次登上了西班牙王位。卡洛斯八世出生于维也纳，他是利奥波德·萨尔瓦托大公与布兰卡·德·波旁公主的小儿子，而他的祖父马德里公爵卡洛斯是卡洛斯派拥护的西班牙王位宣称者。卡洛斯八世在维也纳的托斯卡纳宫长大，后来移居巴塞罗那。他在所有卡洛斯派宣称者中不仅是最年轻的，也是最激进的。他早年便展现出了右翼倾向，他曾加入奥地利的民族主义民兵组织，参加与工团主义者的街头战斗，从维也纳一路打到马德里。如今身为卡洛斯派领袖，卡洛斯八世必将恢复西班牙的信仰，传承荣耀。"
 SPR_memories_of_the_republic:0 "共和之忆"
 SPR_memories_of_the_republic_desc:0 "1932年8月11日，西班牙第二共和国走到了尽头，但共和国仍存在于在许多西班牙人心中。尽管许多人怀有卡洛斯派或社会主义情绪，但许多政治温和派，尤其是军界人士中，希望看到现任西班牙君主制的终结。就连西班牙王国的中间派也公然抗议，这从他们继续使用共和党名称中就可见一斑。而“人民行动”在政变前可能还有一点支持，如今若不采取紧急措施来扭转迅速恶化的局势，其支持率将彻底归零。"

 SPR_cavalry_focus:0 "骑兵团的荣耀"
 SPR_cavalry_focus_desc:0 "当世界大战的恐怖肆虐人间时，骑兵的作战方式似乎已被时代抛弃——铁丝网、机枪与重炮组成的死亡之网，使得传统骑兵部队在大部分战场上沦为历史陈迹。然而在伊比利亚半岛崎岖多山的地形中，战马或许仍能寻得用武之地，尤其是若能将其他兵种与骑兵协同整合，使其运用更适应现代战争需求。"
 SPR_artillery_focus:0 "重视火炮"
 SPR_artillery_focus_desc:0 "火力——这才是我们最迫切的需要。强大的火力能推平敌人一切防御工事，如果他们胆敢越过比利牛斯山，我们就把他们炸个粉碎。"
 SPR_fortress_busters:0 "破障重锤，粉碎一切工事"
 SPR_fortress_busters_desc:0 "现代战争正朝着多个耐人寻味的方向发展，但可以预见的是，防御工事在未来战场上仍将占据重要地位。通过加大对重型火炮的投入，并研发专门针对敌方工事中各类建筑与工程技术的新型炮弹，我们就能确保我军永远不会被敌军的碉堡或地堡所阻滞。"
 SPR_composite_divisions:0 "合成师"
 SPR_composite_divisions_desc:0 "共和派军官在其命运多舛的新军改革中，提出了一个颇具开创性的概念——合成师。与传统步兵单位相比，这些师配备了更加强大的机动火炮力量，但相应地需要更庞大的物资消耗与更复杂的后勤基础设施支撑。不过，凭借压倒性的火力优势，我军士兵将能摧枯拉朽般攻克最顽固的防御目标，碾碎任何深沟高垒、负隅顽抗之敌。"
 SPR_the_queen_on_our_board:0 "战场上的皇后"
 SPR_the_queen_on_our_board_desc:0 "西班牙陆军必须将步兵锻造成全能多面手——他们既能凭借协同炮兵火力在各条战线间快速机动压制敌军，又能依托深挖堑壕固守阵地，抵御敌方攻势甚至反扑。因此，我们必须通过严格训练，使我军步兵师成为国际象棋中纵横捭阖的“后”，凭借其全能优势在战略棋盘上始终压制对手。"
 SPR_fire_superiority:0 "用炮弹淹没敌人"
 SPR_fire_superiority_desc:0 "西班牙炮兵部队的装备虽长期陈旧落后，但如今我们已批量引进德制FK.16野战炮与奥匈M.14野战榴弹炮，将原有法英旧式火炮群升级为混合重炮集群。为此，必须配套建设本土弹药工厂，为新型火炮提供充足炮弹。当工业齿轮开始轰鸣，连绵不绝的弹雨将如钢铁洪流般席卷战场，彻底吞没任何顽抗之敌的防御工事"
 SPR_the_traditional_arm:0 "再无安瓦尔之耻"
 SPR_the_traditional_arm_desc:0 "阿卜杜勒·克里姆率领的里夫部族军在安瓦尔战役中给予的惨败，实乃二十世纪西班牙国运之奇耻。然今厉兵秣马，斥资整饬殖民地守备部队，更以外籍军团为矛尖——革新训练体系，配发新锐装备。此番重整旗鼓，必将令北非群酋知晓：自丹吉尔至休达，自梅利利亚至西属撒哈拉，帝国利剑永悬苍穹，殖民秩序不容撼动分毫。"
 SPR_cyclists_and_sappers:0 "放宽骑兵定义"
 SPR_cyclists_and_sappers_desc:0 "旧世纪定义的骑兵部队确已过时，但广义骑兵概念仍具战略价值。在西班牙欠发达地区，国民警卫队与卡宾枪骑兵仍需依赖战马执行治安巡逻；而正规军骑兵单位作为侦察尖兵、反游击力量及殖民地守备队，依然不可或缺。但若将工兵分队、自行车机动部队纳入骑兵编制，便可赋予其亟需的多功能性与火力投射能力——这种革新可进一步通过配发1916型37毫米TRP步兵炮实现。该型火炮虽在常规战场显陈旧，但其轻便易携的特性与骑兵单位的高机动性完美契合，能在突袭作战中化身“马背上的雷霆”。"
 SPR_heavy_cavalry:0 "现代重骑兵"
 SPR_heavy_cavalry_desc:0 "当西班牙骑兵军官团将骑兵革新纳入战略理论时，古典重骑兵的幽灵正以工业时代的形态复苏。尽管长矛轻骑、胸甲武士已成历史尘烟，但德意志在世界大战中催生的“风暴突击队”经验昭示着——战场永远需要兼具机动性与毁灭性的钢铁尖刀。西班牙军事改革派提出：为何不能以现代化骑兵填补这一战术空白？设想中的“骑乘突击队”既可如德国步兵同僚般下马强攻要塞，亦能依据战场态势瞬息翻身上马实施机动打击。虽然这种“双态作战”模式尚需战场淬炼，但马镫与堑壕的世纪对话，或许正为垂暮的骑兵兵种注入涅槃之火。"
 SPR_motorization:0 "新时代的新马驹"
 SPR_motorization_desc:0 "西班牙军队的机动能力严重不足，以至于地区警察部队的机动化程度往往高于我们的正规部队。这个问题必须立刻解决，我们将与西班牙卡车制造商希斯巴诺·苏莎签约，让他们制造更多卡车来提高我们军队的机动能力。"
 SPR_flesh_over_machine:0 "卡斯蒂利亚铁骑"
 SPR_flesh_over_machine_desc:0 "尽管现代坦克与装甲车堪称威力惊人的武器，但它们仍难与那些意志坚定、装备精良且训练有素的卡斯蒂利亚骑士相抗衡。这些骑士凭借对战斗技艺的绝对掌控，能够在伊比利亚半岛崎岖艰险的地形中，巧妙运用各类战具实现战术机动，其灵活性与适应性甚至超越依靠机械动力的钢铁对手。"
 SPR_maneuvre_warfare:0 "以动制静"
 SPR_maneuvre_warfare_desc:0 "世界大战（尤其在西线战场）演变为一座巨型血肉磨坊，究其根源在于，在机械与自动化武器主导的时代，交战双方均缺乏必要的机动作战能力。我们绝不可重蹈覆辙，因此必须倾尽全力确保西班牙军队具备足够的迅捷性与灵敏性，使其免于陷入世界大战中那种惨烈的消耗战泥潭。"
 SPR_morale_above_all:0 "战者，唯意志之搏也"
 SPR_morale_above_all_desc:0 "当今的\"专家\"或许宣称，战争胜利不过是凭借物资数量或武器质量的物质优势碾压对手。此乃谬见。战争本质上是意志的较量——唯有被真正胜利信念灌注的军队，才能击溃那些斗志涣散、训练懈怠之敌。因此，我们必须确保西班牙士兵做好战争准备，并掌握在这场精神角力中压倒对手的心理制胜法则。"
 SPR_local_terrain_local_means:0 "西班牙特色战法"

It is up to us, the Spanish Jacobins, to drag our nation towards modernity by severing these malicious influences from the nation’s politics, through secularization of various state functions such as education, workers’ unions, and anywhere else that the Church could be using against us.

 SPR_Align_Radicals_and_Agrarians_desc:0 "So far, our control over the Kingdom has solidified our position as the leading force of the moderate democratic right within the nation. However, while we have a foothold in the rural regions, we have yet to fully control the electorate here, and furthermore, we remain a niche party within the urban electorate in Barcelona and BIlbao, where the centers of industry are. However, there are certain elements who are popular in these regions. First is Alejandro Lerroux and his Partido Radical, who is popular in urban centres and have been leaning closer to the right-wing despite starting off as a left-wing anti clerical party. While their nature would sound like they would be hard pressed to be in coalition with a Catholic-oriented party like us, they have been known to be ‘loose’ with their incentives, and with a few ‘material’ incentives, they can be persuaded to work with us. Second is the Partido Agrario, a minor monarchist conservative party whose agenda is similar to ours, but appeals specifically to the rural gentry and landowning classes. Because of their minor status, we can strong-arm them into our new right-wing coalition and potentially even absorb them, preventing other, more radically right wing movements from absorbing them, while bolstering our own popularity with the rural gentry. With these new coalition 'partners', we can create a broad dominant right-wing coalition to counter the worker dominated urban and rural electorates, which are strongholds of left-wing radicals of the various left-wing parties and organizations of the PSOE, CNT-FAI, Izquierda Española and so on."

For now, we must contend with the democratic framework, but if we focus on gathering enough support for the new Patriotic Union, we can dislodge our rivals to a point that we alone can muster the support needed for Spain to thrive under a strong leadership.

As the party gets ready for its governorship period, multiple anarchist and syndicalist theorists, from Spain and abroad, have been called to help the government fix up its program and lead Spain towards a new dawn under a bold new system.

After all, right after the CNT-FAI was allowed to operate in 1936, they proved that the establishment of these styles of communes yielded great results.

Not only will this earn us international support, it will hopefully allow us to integrate, or at least collaborate with, the Mujeres Libres, which can give a considerable boost to our party size and popularity.

In some areas of Northern Spain, small farms known as minifundios are simply too unproductive to be worth much, while in Southern Spain, vast estates known as latifundios cause much grief to Spain’s peasants as they own no land of their own and are subject to the whims of the landowners, in addition to quite terrible pay.

In times of economic crisis, jornaleros are the ones to bear the toughest burden, sometimes resorting to eating grass or tree roots for survival.

After their loss in the \"mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union.\n\nÁngel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility. He stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocater for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists.\n\nWhile  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

One such movement, and the most likely to dislodge the former from their seat as primary monarchist party, is Partido Nacionalista Español. Returning from the brink of irrelevancy, it's fiery denouncement of republican and socialist values has brought it many supporters. Backed by the Catholic church and agrarian peasants from the more conservative regions of Spain, the party seeks to eradicate regionalism by centralizing the Kingdom, defeat the socialist parties by utilizing its supporters in the Sindicatos Libres to harass them, and finish off any republican sentiments by allying with like-minded centre- and extreme-right parties to form a cohesive bloc against anything that would threaten the traditional Spain.\n\nWhile not publicly endorsed by the king, its leader José María Albiñana has announced that he wishes to expand the king's powers closer to their original scope, although the party leader has somewhat tried to moderate this rhetoric to not lose any credibility inside the democratic system. The party views corporatism, social Catholicism and uniting monarch as the cornerstones of its program, and while not anti-democratic per se, many view it with suspicion of harbouring dangerous authoritarian viewpoints. Whether the party will be a death knell to Spain's young democracy or not will be seen, though first this party must pass the hurdle of defeating its rivals in the elections."

In the winding mountain paths leading further into Galicia, snipers and militia irregular ambushed us before retreating further in, stretching the nerves and resolve of our men to the snapping point. General Vega was forced to call for a full retreat after a devastating battle at the Samos Monastery, where Galician militias managed to delay our forces long enough for their reinforcements to pin us down and crush most of the local division.

The king, seeing the writing on the wall, followed in his father’s footsteps, and has boarded a plane headed for Portugal earlier this morning. With the country spiraling out of control, a group of generals have stepped in once more to stop this chaos from leading to total eradication of Spain. Led by the populist general Sanjurjo, the new regime has denounced all enemies of Spain, from anarchists, socialists and republicans all the way to the separatists. The new junta, however, is not exactly united in vision, and the bickering of the generals has made any proper counter-attack against the separatists possible.\n\n Realizing this, general Sanjurjo has gathered the generals for a meeting in the military headquarters of Madrid, seeking to settle the leadership question of the new Spain once and for all. This decision is hardly surprising, as Sanjurjo has immense amount of political clout due to the success of his Sanjurjada, the revolt that ended the republican regime in 1932. However, his rule is far from absolute, as many in Spain and among the military blame him for all the mistakes of the last few years. Contesting his rule are a selection of generals, all with their own visions for Spain. Perhaps the most peculiar character is the leader of the Spanish Legion, José Millan-Astray, who is known as an eccentric fanatic, with some claiming him to be borderline insane due to drug use and war injuries. His polar opposite is Emilio Mola, who is known for his calculating nature and usage of extreme means while working as a chief security official of the Spanish republic and later, kingdom. Camilo Alonso Vega, Juan Yague and Francisco Franco Bahamonde represent more traditional junta members, following many of the tenets established in the Primo de Rivera era, though Alonso Vega and Juan Yague are willing to go further on many issues than Franco. Yague is also known for his sympathies towards Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, a far-right party espousing Hispanist ideology.  Finally, the junta could simply install the son of Primo de Rivera, José Antonio, as the leader. While not a military man, the young Primo de Rivera has been remarkably active in politics of Accion Popular and enjoys a great deal of influence among the far-right of Spain.

The party now leans more towards typical Christian democrats, just with a few more aces up its sleeve and a considerably bolstered radical wing. The king himself has praised this development, claiming that without Accion Popular’s commitment to democracy, the new crown could not have legitimized its rule as easily, and by creating a more moderate version of themselves, Accion Popular has managed to convince many of even Spain’s royal house being able to adjust for the times as well."

 sprd.122.d:0 "The 19th century was very difficult for Spain in general, but few events of that turbulous era left such a mark on Spanish public consciousness as the Spanish-American war of the mid-1890s. The loss of our last overseas colonial holdings in America and Asia, namely the islands of Cuba and Philippines, sent Spanish public into a deep crisis. Our society had been based on imperial glory, colonial pride and the Restoration era circulation of parties, known as el turno pacífico, where the Spanish Liberal and Conservative parties alternated in the government. When the colonies were lost, the entire Spanish economy and cultural basis pulled the plug on this alternating system and revealed the many flaws in it, which in turn lead to academic opposition and protests. These academics would be the very beginnings of Generation ‘98, and while this movement started as a simple protest, it soon evolved into complete regeneration of Spain’s culture, ranging from literature to music. The movement spawned such titans of Spanish culture as Miguel de Unamuno, Pio Baroja and Joaquin Costa.\n\n The generation was highly influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause, who was best known for his arguments for academics to be free of dogmatic thinking, and to some extent, his ideas on divinity more as an universal essence rather than as a personalist mythical figure. The influence of Krausism also helped shape the movement towards more egoist direction. The generation demanded change in Spain’s political scene, and that itself created an atmosphere of acceptance towards radicalism, aimed at changing the stalled political scene and the impotent reforms brought about by el turno pacífico. Like most generations in Spain’s history, Generation of ‘98 was not particularly ideologically aligned, instead inspiring actors from left-wing revolutionaries all the way to the right-wing traditionalists, all calling for Spain to regenerate and rejuvenate itself, though the means to achieve this differed greatly from actor to another. Accion Popular, also greatly inspired by this movement and two of its most prolific writers, Ramiro de Maeztu and Joaquin Costa, has started a program aimed at promoting the ideas and works of the generation, with of course the left-wing ideologues excluded from the program. The leadership of the party hopes that this increased attention will bring about a more patriotic Spanish youth eventually."

 sprd.123.d:0 "Despite our successful electoral results and a rather tremendous reimagination of Accion Popular, the party still remains as a big-tent for various monarchists, both reactionary and liberal, as well as agrarians, Christian democrats and even fringe legionaries. These factions have generally agreed upon a policy of Christian conservatism and moderate monarchism, but as time passes, the factionalism is starting to tear us apart. Leadership of the party, as well as the king, finds this situation untenable. The king has urged us to pick a direction before we face oblivion at the hands of our more ideologically rigid rivals. This decision, however, is bound to be a hard one. We can obviously fully dedicate our party program to Christian democracy, placating the moderates and centre of our party, but losing support from the more radical factions. There are however other, less conventional choices proposed by other party members.\n\n Our prime minister, José María Gil-Robles, has long been an admirer of Austrian right-wing demagogue, Engelbert Dolfuss, and the Austropopulist ideology he champions in the heartland of Catholicism. This choice would be a radical one, as Austropopulism has hardly been tried in a democratic system and its critics consider it wholly incompatible. However, the corporatist, nationalist and fiercely Catholic nature does draw some of the most firebrand monarchists within our party towards this conclusion.\n\n Others, less extreme members of AP seek to steer the movement towards more traditional conservatism, following the Maurist ideology of strong state intervention, moderate Spanish nationalism, social Catholicism and the integration of some liberal ideals into the Spanish right. While less radical than Austropopulism, Maurism is also somewhat marred by the many directions the movement has been pulled towards by various politicians, such as Antonio Goicoechea and Jose Calvo Sotelo. However, Maurism under Gabriel Maura, Antonio’s son, is considered the current mainstream form, and is likely to be the most palatable to democratic Spain."

While Spain is yet to reclaim the glory days of the empire, we have thwarted its descent into chaos and ruin, and from here, we can only take it to greater heights! Spain is back as a global power, and like the armadas of the past, our reach will only grow from here, destroying socialists and agents of false gods as we march onwards. While we may not hold the absolute power we did years ago, Accion Popular has shown itself adaptive enough to fit into the defines of democracy, although very much in our own way.

But the coup of 1932 saved Spain from this terrible fate, and for four years, General Jose Sanjurjo allowed us to rule Spain and shape it in our image. While that period was mired by conflicts within Accion Popular, instability caused by terrorists, both the blasted separatists and the demonic anarchists, and the weak position of our king and government due to military interference, it was also the height of our power thus far. Yet with two electoral victories under our belt in a very short span of time, first against our arch-nemesi, the Carlists and anarchists, and then against the republicans, we have shown thoroughly that the Spanish people trust our rule above all else. \n\nWith this newfound mandate, and the weakened grip of the military on Spanish affairs, we can finally set upon fulfilling the wishes of AP leadership. Spain shall be united and freed from the insidious influence of syndicalists and Carlists alike, and the corrupting influence of republicanism will be cremated once and for all. The various regional parties that constitute the Accion Popular have rallied under the banner of Spanish monarchist right, and we have even been bolstered by defectors from the Carlist cause, so AP is finally strong enough to contest even the strongest ex-republican party in congress. While we are going to be more limited than before due to the democratic system, it is a compromise we have been forced to take.

 sprd.126.d:0 "As the new constitutional monarchy solidifies in Spain, the parties themselves are equally shifting in their policies to fit this new system. One of the most curious cases to observe has been the rebranded Partido Radical led by Alejandro Lerroux, which in the past was a thorn in the kingdom’s side due to its incredibly strong anti-clericalism and negative stance on the monarchy. Lerroux himself was implied to be part of many assassination attempts on king Alfonso even though nothing was ever confirmed. While his party would appear to be our staunchest enemy, this does not need to be the case. Lerroux is known to be a man of many vices, and his party is known for one thing above all else: corruption. In the last years, the radicalism of Partido Radical has vaned immensely, the party becoming little more than a political machine for Lerroux and his clique to chase more wealth and power. As such, while we share little with the Lerrouxists ideologically, allying them would not be particularly difficult.\n\n Accion Popular could promise to invest in the infrastructure of Lerroux’s seat of power, the boulevard of Paraleo in Barcelona, alongside a promise to turn a blind eye to the man’s ‘business’ ventures that certain law enforcement agencies in Spain would otherwise be quite interested in. In exchange, Lerroux would join us in coalition, and as his support base consists of the Spanish workers of Barcelona, we could use their helps to battle the great evils of Catalonia, the anarchists of CNT-FAI and the separatists of Nosaltres Sols. However, while Lerroux is more of an ally of convenience, there are other groups that align with us ideologically but lack the widespread support of AP. An influential but small party, Partido Agrario shares our rural-minded, Catholic and monarchist sentiments, but has always struggled to gather the popular support that we have.

The Peloponnese peninsula has seen nothing but misery, division and paranoia after the last Weltkrieg, and its once proud citizens have become nothing but pawns for the great powers of Europe. But to us loyal and fervent Catholics, no side in that conflict is as important as that of the Papal States, the most holy city serving as the seat of power for the representative of Christ on Earth, the Pope. When Italy fell to war and division, in a rare case of unity both Carlists and Alfonsist monarchists decided to fight side by side to stop the Reds from claiming the city, and the volunteers from that conflicts helped shape Papal-Spanish relations for decades to come. However, given the hard times Spain fell to in the last years, it has been hard to keep these relations as close as we would have liked. Now, however, as Accion Popular has solidified itself as the popular ruler of Spain, we must immediately dispatch an envoy to the Vatican and pledge our undying support to the righteous cause of God. Whichever side the Pope supports in the upcoming unification wars will be our ally as well, and together we shall destroy the godless syndicalists of the north. Italy will be united, and the seat of God’s power protected once more by pious sons of Italy, assisted by the Spaniards at every turn should they require the assistance.

 sprd.128.d:0 "Since the coronation of Isabella II as the queen of Spain, our nation has been plagued by a pestilence known as Carlism. Clinging to an age-old dynastic feud, the Carlists have plunged Spain into numerous civil wars, coming out of their Navarran mountains to harass the good people of Spain. The untold damage they have done to our nation with their delusions and unjustified violence has taken blood, sweat and toil to repair, yet still their presence lingers in Spain’s northern territories, their fanatical followers, Requetes, striking our noble Carabineros like some sort of spectres of ruination. Their corrupting influence has been too hard to root out in the last few difficult decades, but similarly their relevance has been weakened. Only in the last few years during and after the republic did the movement gather enough steam to seriously contest the rightful king’s rule, and when the Carlists unsurprisingly were defeated in the elections, their movement fell apart. The hardliner Cruzadistas supporting Carlos Pio as king blamed the supporters of Javier Bourbon-Parma for the humiliating defeat, claiming that their softness prevented the Carlists from seizing the initiative and defeating the Alfonsine monarchy. The Intergristas, ideologically similar to the Frenchman Charles Maurras but far less concrete in their beliefs, simply either gave up or jumped ship to join Renovacion Espanola. This Carlist defeatism may have been rectified had they managed to unite under one candidate, but as Javier escaped to Algiers and Carlos returned to Austria, the movement began to fizzle out into oblivion. While hardliners still remain especially in Navarre and Basque Country, their numbers are not large enough to contest our rule, and some officers have demanded that the army boots finally stomp this pathetic pretender regime out. Others, such as colonel Valera and general Emilio Mola, current military commissioner of Pamplona, have urged for caution, arguing that the Carlists will run out of steam on their own. Ultimately, the decision lies on the king, as the officer corps is notoriously badly infiltrated by traditionalists, with even general Sanjurjo, the hero of the Alfonsine monarchy, being accused of harbouring Carlist sympathies. Without their leadership, it may be that the Carlists cannot unify en masse, but on the other hand further violence may cause political instability and prolong the existence of the Carlists if the operation fails."

JAP has grown to be one of the most powerful youth organizations in Spain, boasting close to 15 000 members, but its involvement with the regime has been far from easy. JAP continues to be a hotbed of radicalism within Accion Popular, and while in the past, during the years of AP’s sole governance, this was seen as ‘youthful desire to regenerate Spain’ and ‘ideological innovation for future monarchists’, this radicalism has become an awkward issue for the party. As Accion Popular has pretty much been strong-armed into the mold of a democratic party, the rascals of JAP are constantly causing us scandals and crises with their clashes with liberals and socialists. The movement’s current head, José María Valiente Soriano, is a known traditionalist, and has even been accused of secretly harbouring Carlist sympathies in the past. His traditionalism has particularly hampered the moderation of JAP, as he turns a blind eye to any bloodshed of former republicans, and some within AP believe that he is coordinating attacks to further his own agenda. However, due to his tenure as the movement’s leader and strong connections to the original leadership of AP, it would be costly to remove him. But should we choose to do so, a likely successor in the form José María Pérez de Laborda has already been chosen by AP’s leadership. The decision won’t be easy, but it could finally bring an end to the stubborn struggle of japistas. "

 sprd.130.d:0 "As PNE's stewardship of Spain continues, the party has begun to see itself transform to fit its new role. While originally a big tent party of various right-wing ideologues, drawing its support from rural agrarian peasants, anti-syndicalist militants and radical  Catholic clergymen, the party now spends about as much time balancing these interests as it does forming policies and creating laws. The prime minister Albiñana finds this situation untenable, as it stretches the party thin and causes internal conflicts that are easily exploited by its main rivals, socialists of PSOE and the liberals of Izquierda Española and Union Española. A small-scale congress has been called among party elites to finally settle the ideological differences and create an unified structure. After all, a party calling for Spain to unite as whole is laughable if it cannot unify itself first. As the congress begins, several blocs form within it. Among the most influential is the Legionaries of Albiñana, who propose following the Romanian and Italian Legionary model but form-fitting it to the conditions of Spain. This would see the movement pay lip service to democracy while pursuing its policies of heavy nationalism, militarization and political repression of undesirable influences on Spanish \"nature\".\n\n They are opposed by the Christian democratic wing, which calls for the movement to adopt policies championed by various Spanish Catholic parties, but with an even firmer grip and vision than those parties usually contain. Highly monarchist and pro-clergy, it would see the movement transition into a more traditionalist position, and likely cause the integration of various smaller Christian democrat parties, such as Partido Agrario, into our movement.\n\n However, there is one more faction within PNE that champions the adoption of a very specific brand of Catholic nationalism, the Mexican Synarchism, which would likely see our movement take a rather autocratic turn. While it would likely not be impossible to utilize this form of ideology inside a democratic system, something PNE must at least attempt to adhere to, it would mean large compromises to function. Lastly, something Albiñana himself supports, is the ideological drift towards Hispanism, something he himself became familiar with during his time in Mexico. While that particular idea is mostly a Latin American one, Albiñana argues that ideas from that movement could be applied to the Spanish setting just as well. Doing so would likely increase Spain's interest in the former colonies, although what shape this interest would take remains to be seen. It would also likely strengthen the anti-regionalist wing of PNE. The congress discussed these issues at length, but ultimately one side emerges victorious."

 sprd.131.d:0 "Shortly after their victory in the elections, in fact right in the middle of PNE's lavish ceremony to celebrate their triumph, the king of Spain summoned the party leadership and upcoming ministers to an audience with the monarch. The new government may have expected a warm welcome given PNE's overt monarchism, but the king and his advisers raised their demands almost immediately after a short congratulatory note. PNE's history with paramilitary action and terror tactics against political opponents were denounced by the king. He proclaimed that now the party had entered into mainstream politics and was responsible for Spain's governance, it would have to moderate its rhetoric and means to achieve political goals. According to the king and his advisors, they would not allow for such barbaric street clashes and polarization as Alfonso XIII had done, for Spain had nearly been destroyed twice by it.\n\n For the good of the monarchy and Spain itself, the party would have to seek a compromise between its firebrand agenda and the democratic system, or else it would lose credibility in the eyes of the king and his people. Albiñana was quick to assure the king that while PNE was committed to its program, it would make necessary adjustments needed for stability of the realm. The Legionaries of Albiñana would return to their original purpose as the party leader's personal bodyguards. Similarly, Albiñana's initial plan was to focus on its less controversial policies first, such as implementation of the corporatist system, agrarian reforms, education reform to expand access of middle and lower class students to higher education and the strengthening of church status. The king seemed to agree with these notions for now, though Albiñana was certain that the King's secret service would keep an eye open for their activities. Still, if moderation was temporarily needed for PNE's transformation of Spain, then it would have to do for the time being."

 sprd.132.d:0 "It is no secret that PNE draws most of its support from the countryside, from the pious and humble folk of Spain’s heartlands. Yet these folks do not exclusively support our party, their support also going to the blasted socialists of FNTT, the accursed anarchists of CNT-FAI and the primordial enemy of all true monarchists, the Carlists. While we can only hope that these lost souls find their way to the light one day, there are other parties more aligned with our ideology that could be integrated into PNE. Probably the most important would be Partido Agrario, a small party in the large-scale Spanish politics but still highly important, especially in local level. They have also historically been willing to ally with the Carlists, especially during the republican era, so absorbing them into our organization would starve the wounded Carlists of one more ally.\n\n Of lesser significance are the Derecha Regional Agraria and Peña Blanca, first being a group of agrarians and Christian democrats representing the national part of the regional party, Derecha Regional Valenciana and the second being a group of wealthy landowners and traditionalist monarchists. While these two parties are not massive by any means, the populist approach of DRA and the wealth of PB’s members would serve our cause well. However, some of the members of Pena Blanca are known to be associated with the extremely radical monarchist faction, Renovacion Espanola, and associating with them could bring the ire of the more moderate republicans on us. Similarly, DRA is in turn possibly too moderate for our party, causing us to slip closer to the compromising Christian democrats. Though some within our party have also argued that should we integrate DRA, it could serve as a facade to our commitment to democracy, allowing our more militant wing to continue their actions against the insidious forces seeking to corrupt the Spanish spirit."

 sprd.133.d:0 "As PNE grows into the role of the steward of Spain’s right-wing movements, we have attracted many prominent right-wing thinkers from other parties, such as Eduardo Callejo de la Cuesta and Pedro Sainz Rodríguez, as well as the monarchist generals Antonio Aranda and Luis Orgaz Yoldi, joining us mostly from the monarchist parties Union Monarquica Nacional and Accion Espanola. However, probably the largest influence to our movement has been Ramiro de Maeztu, known theorist of Hispanidad, a set of central characteristics of the Hispanic race. While de Maeztu has been forced to tone down his rabid anti-democratic rhetoric upon joining the party, due to PNE’s attempt to hold at least a facade of adhering to democracy, his ideas of Hispanidad have been instrumental in the party’s direction ever since the theorist joined us.\n\n The main tenets of his beliefs are outlined in the book released in 1934, Defensa de la hispanidad, where he argues that Spanish, and in more general terms, Hispanic peoples, must return to ‘pure Spanishness’. In de Maeztu’s words this means a spiritual connection between Spain and its former colonies, not guided by the false gods of liberalism and rationalism but the indomitable Spanish spirit, bolstered by his own take on the French revolutionary slogan ‘liberty, equality, fraternity’ being replaced with ‘duty, hierarchy, and humanity’. The Catholic faith and mission is also very heavily visible in his theories, seeing Catholic teachings of hierarchy, charity and humble servitude as a counterpoint to the isolating and selfish ideals of the Western individualist liberalism. His critics have in turn attacked him for being only half-Spanish himself, as his mother was British, and yet more have considered de Maeztu’s inclusion into PNE problematic due to his sister, Maria de Maeztu’s activities with feminism and liberalism. Still, his theories are far too important to our movement to pass up, and as de Maeztu approached Prime Minister Albiñana directly, it was impossible for the latter to decline the offer of such a prolific right-wing ideologue."

Sad reality is that the union was unsuccessful in its aims to create an apolitical movement aimed solely at uniting the Spanish people on the fundamentally excellent values of Catholicism and corporatism. Yet from seeds of failure PNE must grow a new union, following in the values of Primo de Rivera into a new dawn, even if minor concessions must be made towards the whining voices of former republicans, who still cling to democracy as if it could save Spain.\n\n Under the king’s watchful eye, we will attempt to merge the values of Unión Patriótica in a new way, creating local branches of PNE that will allow it to fit local conditions better, while still supporting the core values of our ideology. This new direction, partially inspired by the Carlists in its function given Albiñana’s fascination with traditionalism, will focus on the core ideals of country, religion and monarchy as the pillars of Spanish society. However, one part where our new party structure will differ from the original ideals of Unión Patriótica is in the continued utilization of Albiñana’s Legionaries.\n\n While majority of the movement will consist of ‘neutral men of pious faith and good ideas’, Albiñana’s Legionaries will always be there, in the shadows, preying on any socialist or syndicalist guerillero who dares to intervene in the creation of a pure, loyal Spanish state. Another idea taken directly from the original ideas of Primo de Rivera is the recreation of Somatén, a rural defence force especially in Catalonia that will ensure the rights of property owners and punish the eternal threat of Marxist infiltration into our loyal farmer folk."

PNE has always stood at the forefront of neo-traditionalism, leaving behind the shackles of past that the Carlist cling onto, while revering Spain’s sacred institutions and traditions to the greatest extent. After all, few nations can claim such a glorious legacy as the mighty Espana. And yet, despite all this, despite all the glories our nation has created and achieved, even in our beloved Iberia the separatist rot gnaws at Hispanic unity and purity. The Basques, supposedly an ancient race yet to our eyes, just a relic of the past, still retain their outdated language and customs. At the very least they have seen the good graces of God and follow Catholicism almost as fervently as any loyal sons of Spain.\n\n But whereas Basques have some redeeming qualities, in the land of the Catalans, there is little of such notions to be found. These fools claim that they have a right to a Catalan nationhood, yet have never existed as an independent nation, only ever as a part of Spain and its numerous smaller kingdoms. Their most radical members even hatched the sinister plot to murder beloved king Alfonso XIII and almost succeeded, going mostly unpunished until now. This, simply cannot stand. The Basque and Catalan nationalists will be destroyed or assimilated, their leaders imprisoned or driven to exile. Already, Carabineros and Guardia Civil troops are being directed to these areas to drive the separatists out, and they will be assisted by our excellent Legionaries as well as the newly established Somatén of Catalonia. Their rot will never again spoil a single harvest of Spain’s finest, and not a single loyal son of Spain will be lead to separatist delusions.

In truth, the reformation of the movement from street thugs fighting strikers and socialist agitators into the only traditionalist democratic party in Spain has not been an easy one, as the Legionaries constantly feel sidelined by the politicians and civilians. This isn’t helped by Albiñana’s calls for moderation within their ranks. The Legionaries were originally described as Albiñana to be ‘citizen volunteers with direct, fulminating and expeditious intervention in any act that threatens or depresses the prestige of the country’, so it is not surprising that as their actions are more moderated and constrained, the men are getting restless.\n\n In order to stop these young, active and energetic men from jumping ship to some other radical movements, such as Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica, we must find them some enemies to fight, especially given our precarious position in the public eye. In the past, the Legionaries caused many victories for the traditionalist cause, defeating Catalan nationalists, socialists and liberals alike, but as many of these forces have now become our parliamentary rivals, attacking them in such a brash manner would sour our image in the public eye.\n\n As we have to play by the soft playbook of parliamentary politics, at last for now, the targets for Legionaries must instead be those of the radicals. We could break relations with the Carlists, who we have so far been quite close to, and gain support from the liberals and Alfonsine monarchists, but this would cause us to lose a political ally otherwise. Similarly, we can focus on the radical socialists and anarchists of CNT-FAI, and crush these insolent terrorists once and for all. Final option is to divert the Legionaries to combat Catalans, Basques and Galicians who seek to gain their independence from Spain, but this would mean leading the men away from the heartland of Spain and make them temporarily unavailable to use against other political opponents."

The members of Partido Sindicalista approved this request as well, an easy decision given the members of Third Internationale already saw them as traitors given their more liberal current of syndicalism.

However, dreams of an united Iberia, one where the division of two nations would be washed away and their cultures unified under one banner, are nothing new. Closest example of these dreams was during the First Spanish Republic, when the idea of a federal Spain gave way to even more grandiose ideas of Iberian federation. These never came to fruition, and this sense of an unified peninsula were forgotten in part after the wave of Hispanism that rose to the forefront after the loss of Cuba and Philippines in 1898. But while Spanish reactionaries and imperialists desperately hanged on to misplaced imperial legacy, among the ranks of the anarchist FAI and its youth division, Federación Ibérica de Juventudes Libertarias, Iberism gained some ground, even leading to talks with their Portuguese comrades, though the lack of enthusiasm from Portugal did put a damper on the spread of Iberism there.\n\n Now, however, with Partido Sindicalista guiding Spain, some within our movement have resurrected the idea of an united Iberia, even though the form this would take differs greatly from the ideas of FAI. While this idealism was originally not considered worth pursuing, given the hesitancy of PS’ leadership to participate in wars, the tyrannical rule of the Portuguese monarchy and increasing shift towards totalitarianism has made many question whether we can allow such an affront to all democratic values to occupy the peninsula.

While this liberation has often been mentioned in anarchist literature and theories, actual commitment to it in the ranks of CNT-FAI and its FIJL youth wing has been dubious. As such, Mujeres Libres drives the vanguard of anarchist liberation of women, and given the passivity of CNT-FAI, we could possibly gain the votes of Mujeres Libres if we fully committed to the cause of gender equality.

The reactionaries of Renovacion Espanola and Traditionalist Communion as well as moderates of Accion Popular claimed that Spain would fall to Communard syndicalism, and only the defensive statements of the king and moderates committed to democracy kept Spain from falling into chaos and civil strife again. Today, after all our programs have been launched, it is clear that Partido Sindicalista has proven the fearmongers wrong. While they may not agree with our policies, we have remained faithful to the new democratic values of Spain, and the restraint with which Pestana and other members of the party have shown during these last months has even caused worldwide discussion of how Possibilism can walk the tightrope of anarcho-syndicalist ideals, liberal democratic realities and most importantly, the utter paradox of a syndicalist Spain lorded over by a monarch.\n\n Over the border, the French communards see us as little more than traitors to the cause, but we can stand proud in the fact that we have, truly, made this paradox work, and through our actions, Spain has entered a new era of true freedom, equality and progress."

To be frank, Pestaña never expected this victory, as while many among the now largely defunct CNT-FAI joined his party, they were still in many ways smaller than even some of the centrist parties. However, PS's  last few rallies gathered enough support to propel the newcomer party to victory, but now it must face a difficult dilemma. Many within PS demand significant changes in Spain, but pushing too hard for reforms at such an early level could cause Spain to collapse into a civil war, something that was so narrowly avoided not long ago. As such, while many radicals within PS call for a complete social revolution and toppling of the monarchy, Pestaña and the party leadership have focused their efforts instead on making economic reforms with the help of syndicalist unions, utilizing the literary clubs of CNT-FAI to spread education among workers and completely rehauling the rural and naval industries, where PS's main support base is working in.\n\nNew coalition has been formed with PSOE, Izquierda Española and Union Española, which will help the small majority PS has immensely.Already, alliances with the anti-clerical parties are being struck to hammer in new legislation, further curtailing church grip on the rural population. Criminal justice is being rehauled to be more democratic, and party envoys have been sent to Izquierda Española and PSOE to further coordinate labour law developments, and while the party must make massive compromises when it comes to combating capitalists, PS is however proposing massive changes among both rural and urban workers. It remains to be seen if the new party can push its heavily syndicalist program against its caqiquismo and clerical enemies, but so far moral in the party remains high."

After their loss in the \"mandate' elections of 1937, the movement seemed to honour the agreement at first, but parts of CNT and FAI eventually regressed back into using terror tactics against their class enemies. However, given the electoral success of moderate socialists in PSOE, and their shown ability to achieve many rather radical reforms without revolutionary means, there are those within CNT-FAI who have become disillusioned to the extreme methods of the party and union. Ángel Pestaña and his followers inside the political movement have published the so-called Manifiesto de los Treinta, which condemned these means and called for the party to instead focus its attention to obtaining legal credibility.\n\nHe stressed the successes of PSOE in similar strategy, and as a long-time advocate for CNT-FAI to become a true political party as well as first-hand witness to the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia decades ago, his words managed to convince many in the ranks of the anarchists. While  many hardliners will not accept this shift, a considerable bulk of CNT-FAI members have joined the new Partido Sindicalista, Pestaña's new party. The new party has announced that it will run in the coming elections, and while not a forerunner for election winner, they may have a chance at victory if enough anarchists abandon their previous anti-political attitude and turn up to the polls to support their parliamentary comrades. Right-wing parties, principally Accion Popular, Derecha Regional Agrario and the Carlists have condemned them as agents of Communards, but the king and most of Cortes have allowed them to run as part of the democratic process, especially considering how it weakens the terrorist side of CNT-FAI."

Despite quite a bit of insults and threats being shared between Gil-Robles and the most fervent Republicans, namely Azaña and Lerroux, the talks were successful in negotiating the terms of a new constitutional framework that could possibly see Spain transform into a true constitutional monarchy. This has not been seen as a particularly joy-filled occasion by either the republicans nor the monarchists, but both sides have seen just how close Spain was to total collapse, and are willing to work together to avoid such a scenario. The question of more radical left-wing parties will be determined later, but for now, the republican parties have given their tacit support to the regime, and eagerly await the upcoming elections promised by AP representatives."

It is this disunity that often makes us forget the father of Spanish socialism, Pablo Iglesias. The unshakeable resolve of Pablo led the Spanish socialists from the founding of PSOE under him and his comrades all the way to the de Rivera dictatorship. Iglesias Posse had to endure prison, poverty and repression for his beliefs, and despite his humble upbringing, produced the theoretical and conventional background to Spanish socialism through his sheer dogged determination towards worker’s liberation and massive productivity in written works.\n\n Pablo Iglesias Posse exemplifies the qualities of a truly conscious Spanish worker, and despite all the differences of ideological orientation that Spanish left-wing activists today possess, we should all unite in celebrating the achievements of Iglesias. As PSOE celebrates its electoral victory, the party leadership has also unveiled a plan to make the birthday of Iglesias Posse into a national holiday, a kind of second First of May, to remember the difficulties Spanish labour faced in its long struggle for worker’s rights, and the men that made it possible."

Others, notably Julian Besteiro himself, have stressed the importance of moderation, highlighting the notable improvements in stability, individual rights and even economic growth that have slowly creeped back into Spain after the horrible anarchy and chaos of the mid-1930s. Still, PSOE was deeply divided between these two battlelines for revolution or continued evolution.\n\n Only the intervention of a deeply surprising figure helped dissipate the tension, as the former staunch revolutionary and admirer of Russian Bolsheviks, Luis Araquistáin, came forth to press the importance of cooperation between Spanish socialists, former republicans and moderate monarchists. He commented that only the peaceful adherence to democracy and curtailment of radical rhetoric will save Spain from another dictatorship or even worse, a full-scale civil war. While in no way a monarchist, Araquistáin considers the monarchy as a necessary concession to the monarchists to maintain the democratic system.\n\n These statements immediately made Araquistáin enemy number one for the revolutionaries within PSOE, but his rhetoric and call for peace convinced many moderates to take a far more dogged stance on the defense of moderation, and even turned some of the more radical PSOE members into adopting a more moderate stance. PSOE is not fully free of tensions, of course, but this newfound commitment to democracy has earned praise from the more centrist parties as well as the king himself."

Besteiro has been an admirer of Karl Kautsky for a long time, and while he did support Russian Revolution due to considering it the only option besides chaos, his opinions on a socialist revolution in Spain have been very different. Like Kautsky, Besteiro considers a socialist revolution and a dictatorship of the proletariat to be a childish fantasy, and the syndicalist model of Union of Britain or the French Commune to be incompatible with Spain’s meager industrial base and highly polarized unions.\n\nForming his ideological basis from Revisionist Marxist, Krausist and positivist currents, Besteiro instead believes that Spanish socialists must use the tools of the current democratic system to their advantage, to improve the economic and social conditions of the Spanish workers and peasants, and so that one day the society is ready advance to a socialist system thoroughly. The electoral participation and victories of PSOE inside the democratic system have further strengthened the right-wing of PSOE led by Besteiro. More radical figures such as Largo Caballero and Indalecio Prieto hold considerable amount of support, it is clear that Besteiro’s vision for the party is increasingly becoming the dominant one."

Spanish democracy has flourished, and in part our policies have made Spain more equal and conscious of the issues our poorest folk face on a daily basis. Our party has united under the vision of Besteiro, bringing German ideals of a moderate, parliamentary socialism that will one day lead Spain into socialism through step-by-step reform, not violent revolution.\n\nWhere once we were considered a red menace that would swallow Spain and turn it into dictatorship of the workers, today we are trusted partners, or at least respected rivals, to the liberals and conservatives of the Cortes.

 sprd.154.d:0 "When the republic was proclaimed in 1931 and the oppressive dictatorship was finally overthrown, something within the anarcho-syndicalist movement of CNT-FAI began to change. Previously, the movement had been purely revolutionary in nature, clashing with the SIndicatos Libres, Carabineros and Guardia Civil many times and seeking to one day bring the results seen in France in the aftermath of the Weltkrieg to Spain as well. But as even PSOE adopted some degree of parliamentarism, some within CNT-FAI began to question whether the aggressive rhetoric of the movement was simply harming them. SImilarly, the anti-political nature of CNT-FAI led to them not appearing in elections and thus the trade union and its sister group FAI couldn’t achieve many actual political goals outside of grassroots organization. \n\nMany within CNT began to advocate for a new direction, especially after the domination of FAI began to influence the effectiveness of CNT’s union activities. Eventually, the situation erupted with the Manifesto of the Thirty, that called for CNT-FAI to abandon its anti-political stance and to become a proper, legitimate party participating in elections and the parliamentary system. While the movement failed to shift the direction of CNT-FAI completely, these moderates did manage to cause CNT-FAI to accept the results of the recent elections, and have now pushed more heavily for the movement to stop its terror tactics. \n\nAmong these treintistas, there has even been talks about forming their own party to fully represent the Spanish libertarians and syndicalists in the democratic system, especially now that CNT-FAI has begun to radicalize once more after its election defeat. We could capitalize on this split in the movement and try to convince these moderates to cooperate with us and try to push CNT-FAI off its radicalized platform, as despite all the similar ideas we share with the anarchists, they tend to oppose us more than agree with us, making our position in charge more difficult. But should there be a more moderate section of CNT-FAI, perhaps as a coalition partner with us, more could likely be achieved by our politicians."

Earlier today, members of the Federación Nacional de Trabajadores de la Tierra, UGT’s agricultural section, have protested en masse to the policies of PSOE and UGT, demanding that the government takes direct action towards the difficulties of rural people of Spain. FNTT’s support is critical to the continued governance of PSOE, and similarly earning goodwill among the rural folk would not be a bad thing considering how many of them currently support our rivals on the right, especially in Accion Popular and Partido Agrario. \n\nAs such, conceding to FNTT’s demands, the PSOE government has called for an extra session to tackle the issues. The list of issues is manifold, ranging from lack of proper farming equipment, terrible labour laws leading to excessively lengthy daily hours, poor division of land and the domination of local societies by the so called caciquismos, powerful political machines that keep the Spanish farmer constrained to their economic situation through dirty tactics. While the other issues raised by FNTT representatives will require a much larger agrarian reform, we could focus on the caciquismo for now and destroy their reign in the rural areas. While it won’t magically fix these areas, a bit of well-deserved revenge will make us more popular among the poor people of the farmer communities. Similarly, seizing assets stolen by the political machines from the people will allow us to fund local councils and institutions of FNTT so that they can actually begin making meaningful reforms."

UGT collaborated with the dictator, and managed to eke out an existence despite the repressive nature of the regime, but this did mean that its reputation was somewhat tarnished by this collaboration. While CNT was harshly repressed, it did gain the sympathies of those opposing the military dictatorship, and thus has utilized its anti-establishment status to draw supporters away from UGT. However, as PSOE’s status solidifies, UGT leadership has chosen to pursue even deeper ties with our party, seeking a symbiosis similar to that between CNT and FAI, hoping to regain some of its lost pride by associating even more closely with our successful party.\n\n Some within UGT have protested this as muddling union politics with government politics, while PSOE moderates see the UGT’s more radical leadership, especially the current Chairman Largo Caballero, as a threat to PSOE’s new approach. This closer cooperation would also make the more anti-establishement members of UGT uneasy, and they could drop out of the union to go join more radical left unions.

He has historically been so heavily against these groups that many have even questioned if the man is truly a socialist at all, while others with less critical viewpoints have compared him to the Mensheviks of Russia. This has been in contrast to the famous, or infamous, Lenin of Spain, Largo Caballero, even though Caballero himself has many times collaborated with Spain’s dictators himself. Either way, the more moderate stance on socialism has earned him great praise and support, and in the recent elections he swept his more radical rivals by a very clear margin. In a Spain craving for some stability after the dark days, Besteiro has provided an alternative to radicalist demagogues.\n\n However, he himself is torn between various more moderate currents on socialism. While currently Besteiristas lead a large coalition of liberal socialists, Austromarxists and Kautskyites, this has proven to be somewhat of a difficult front to keep, especially in a party already struggling from division between moderates and radicals. As such, Besteiro must now decide upon a certain model of socialism the PSOE shifts towards. Clearest choice is to simply maintain democratic socialism and utilize socialist policies and tools to push policies both through trade unions and parliamentary methods.\n\n Significant support is also provided to the Austromarxist wing of the party argues that in a nation as large and diverse as Spain, the ideas and theories towards nationalism and socialism as unifying forces between central power and minorities could work to counteract dangerous separatism and regionalist ultratraditionalists like the Carlists. Finally, Besteiro could adopt the ideology of his personal favourite socialist theorist, Karl Kautsky, who argued for socialists to adopt a strategy of achieving a transition from capitalism to socialism through working within the capitalist framework and evolving society at large towards a new system, without the need for a costly revolution."

With the integration of many regionalist parties, such as Esquierra Catalana and the Galician ORGA, we have slipped further to the left, and while Azaña was a committed middle-class republican in the past, the party has evolved beyond that now. We alienated our supporters years ago by trying to push left-leaning reforms on the other hand and holding back on truly embracing the workers.

As such, Azaña and his ministers have announced more radical policy ideas, especially in relation to minority rights of Spain, educational reform, agrarian reform and cultural funding intended to finally break the damage done to Spanish spirit by the likes of Generation of ‘98.

Manuel Azaña has always been a very outspoken critic of the Generation of ‘98, and now that the new generation is rising to challenge the ideals of the Regenerationist, Izquierda Espanola has pledged to support these new creators of art in their endeavors.\n\nGeneration of ‘27 has been characterized as a merging of Spain’s popular culture with the folklore of Iberia, and while this new movement is hard to break down to its essentials due to the awe-inspiring variety of styles it holds, it is generally considered to be a Spanish embracing of the avant-garde principles promoted usually in various Communards circles. Some styles followed by the Generation include Surrealism, Futurism, Cubism and Ultraism, and the forms of art that have embraced this new generational spirits appear in music, poetry, painting and literature in general, pushed onwards by such savants like Federico Garcia Lorca, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel and K–Hito.\n\nThis new form of artist expression is drawing many eyes towards Spain, especially in a time where Europe itself is focusing on wartime production and other far less artistic pursuits.

However, Izquierda Espanola has historically been quite stalwart ally of regionalist party, with Manuel Azaña personally pushing heavily for the proposed Estatuto de autonomía for Catalonia, though this proposition never got off the ground because of the military coup. But now, with the dark days of Sanjurjada a mere memory, our government has decided to push this controversial statute through, with expansion to our allies in Partido Galeguista and Partido Nacionalista Vasca in Galicia and Basque country in addition to Catalan regional reform.\n\nThese autonomous regions will gain a largely independent tax system, and jurisdiction over health and welfare within their regions, with their regional languages fully accepted alongside Spanish in regional matters. While Catalans especially had hoped for a full Catalanization of the region and dropping the requirement for Spanish as an official language, it seems that the concessions have been more than enough. In order to placate regional nationalists, the use of regional flags, such as the Catalan Senyera and Basque Ikurrina, and regional anthems, such as Catalan Els Segadors, has been allowed in official use as well. While this does make Spain less centralized, it does feed into Azaña’s personal agenda to fulfill a vision of Spain that is simultaneously one and multiple, fit to the realities of the nation and not to some chauvinistic agenda of a Castilian dominance.\n\nIt has also pushed many parties that would likely otherwise support our rivals into becoming staunch allies of Izquierda Espanola, such as the Basque nationalist or Catalan Lliga Catalunya. Many within Partido Radical have protested this new statute, and Lerroux himself has called it a dangerous mistake that will simply invite separatism, but given their minority in the Cortes, there’s been little they have been able to do."

It is no secret that Izquierda Espanola has struggled heavily in this new situation, given its very clear roots in republicanism, but now that enough time has passed from the painful memory of the republic, it is clear that the new transformation of Izquierda has been a beneficial one.\n\nThe presence of the monarchy and the mistakes done during the Republic era have caused our leadership to reinvent itself to less strictly middle class party with narrow support from petite bourgeois, into a party that is more aligned with the common people. Our alliances with the more radical left-wing parties have made it possible for us to push many of the laws we wished to achieve back in 1931, and thanks to these alliances we have influenced parties like PSOE and Partido Sindicalista to adopt a more democratic form, abandoning their firebrand revolutionary rhetoric.

Back then, the republic had been too weak to resist, and now, Sanjurjo could simply scoff at any such pitiful attempts to purge the military. If Azaña and his band of troublemakers had been unable to dislodge the powerful Spanish military from its rightful place at the height of Republic’s power, what hope did they have now that the king was in power once more? Sanjurjo grabbed a pen from his desk, beginning to write an order to Guardia Civil to sweep the conspiratory circle of Izquierda Espanola, to root this type of nonsense before it got dangerous enough. However, the pen dropped from the general’s hand as the door was kicked in, and three heavily armed Carabineros soldiers stepped into the rooms, leveling their Star submachine guns at the officer. They were followed by two men in uniform, generals Quiepo de Llano and Miguel Cabanellas Ferrer.\n\n Sanjurjo attempted to protest the intrusion, but he was quickly shut down by de Llano, who announced that Cabanellas Ferrer would be taking over as the leader of Guardia Civil starting immediately, and Sanjurjo would be escorted to a military court for his role in the 1932 uprising, especially due to his Carlist connections. As the general was grabbed by the Carabineros, he once more protested, cursing the two other officers for betraying their military brethren so callously. de Llano and Cabanellas Ferrer, known for harbouring republican sentiments, merely scowled at the officer as he was dragged out. The man who had attempted to follow in Primo de Rivera’s shoes had clearly lacked the ability that the former had possessed, the ability to slip out of Spain when the tide had clearly turned against him. Around Spain, similar arrests were carried out, the plotters of Sanjurjada disgraced and expelled from the military, receiving harsh sentiments. Even the monarchy, which they had helped restore, turned a blind eye to them, with the king remembering the role of a puppet his father had been forced into by the ruthless military junta.

IE has visibly shifted to the left even more than before, and while the party used to be a liberal centrist one, it is closer to the PSOE than the Radicals of UE today. As such, many prominent politicians within the party, especially those integrated from smaller parties such as Partido Galeguista and Esquerra Republicana Catalunya, have called for a party convention that would hammer home the new direction of the party. Azaña himself supports continuing the current policy of reformist capitalism, but he is also known to exhibit some authoritarian tendencies, especially when it comes to dealing with right-wing extremists, anarchists, the military and Church influence, and thus Azaña would likely support adopting an even more iron-gripped style of governance.\n\n Many of the more liberal and pacifist members of the party are disgusted by such proposals, but there are also those who support these lines of thought as necessary within the new monarchist structure. Some have however, offered a middle-ground between the capitalist and authoritarian camps, seeking to bring about American-style progressivism with a Spanish radical stint into the political field of Spain. There are also some smaller, less prominent trains of thought going on within Izquierda Espanola, with Marcelino Domingo from the recently integrated Independent Radical Socialist Party promoting liberal socialism as an alternative to PSOE’s Marxism and UE’s Radicalism. Probably the smallest but still influential group is also the Georgist members of IE and its regionalist support parties, most prominently represented by Blas Infante, who advocate for the adoption of Henry George’s famous single-tax ideology in Spain. While minor, the influence of Infante especially in Andalusia has won this small branch considerable success within IE.."

 sprd.167.d:0 "As the Republic sought to fight back against the forces of traditionalism and reaction, Manuel Azaña’s Izquierda Republicana and its allies, notably Union Republicana, sought to utilize a strategy of wide popular front, comprised of left-wing parties of a immense variety of ideological strains. This alliance, while costly and sometimes incredibly cumbersome to uphold, did allow us to make sure that the right-wing parties struggled to gain a majority. Only the backbone of any reactionary action, the military, managed to snatch the reins of progress and governorship from the popular front, and even then the response from the left almost sent the country into a civil war. As Spain continues to heal, and our party has managed to return to its rightful place as the supreme rulers of Spain, the question once again returns, how to contest the ever-present right-wing reactionaries from contesting our rule? Given the existence of the monarchy and the four years of right-wing dictatorship, Spain’s culture has once again steered more towards traditionalism, and thus we must increase our efforts to pry the nation out of this rot, into a brighter dawn.\n\n The idea of a popular front has resurfaced, and we have already sent invitations all over Spain. Most prominent parties are of course Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola, Julian Besteiro’s PSOE and even the moderate syndicalists of Partido Sindicalista and the right-communists of Joaquin Maurin’s BOC. Progressive regionalist parties such as Vangarda Nazionalista Galego, Partido Galeguista, ORGA and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya alongside the Basque conservatives and moderate socialists in PNV and ANV respectively have clamoured to join the front as well, seeing us as their best option to enact sufficient regionalist autonomy reforms. Many former republicans, such as the leaders of the Jabali group, Ramon Franco and Blas Infante, have also endorsed the front as a necessary measure to combat the reactionaries under the monarchy. Our overwhelming support should make it easy for the Popular Front to defeat the reactionaries in future elections, although we must not become complacent even with our new political bulwark."

 sprd.168.d:0 "Manuel Azaña watched the bustling city streets of Madrid from the second floor window of Palacio de las Cortes. As Spaniards hurried along to their jobs or daily tasks, the street was like a path for ants. Now that Spain’s political situation had stabilized, people had taken to the streets in a new sense of security, no longer burdened by fears of a civil war or spiraling back to the years of pistolerismo like in 1910s and early 1920s. Slowly but surely, Spain was healing, something which made even the usually muted prime minister crack a small smile. However, it quickly dissolved from his face as the red and yellow flags of the Spanish kingdom waved in the light breeze down the street, reminding Azaña that even if the threat of a Spanish collapse had been avoided, Spain was still under the grip of the monarchy. Few people in Spain had done as much to achieve the dream of a Spanish republic as Azaña, and yet all those dreams had been pummeled into the dirt by the military when the conspiracy of Sanjurjada succeeded and toppled the Second Spanish Republic. The years in exile had not been easy, seeing the dysfunctional Spanish monarchy restored and Spain’s noble people subjected to the tyranny of the military and their lackeys in Accion Popular.\n\n Yet when the inevitable happened and the military was forced to give in before the storm of popular action, a small hope rekindled in the defeated Republicans, and as the exiles were amnestied, Spain saw a true resurgence of democratic will. Yet for Azaña, the situation has been difficult to adjust. A life-long republican, he has always seen the monarchy as simply incompatible with truly free, parliamentary democracy, yet as the king has granted his support for democracy and other parties have adopted a more moderate stance towards the monarchy, Azaña has had to readjust his beliefs. Even now, as he watches the royal flag of Spain wave, the ex-president of the republic can only think back to the tricolour that once waved over Madrid’s roofs, and the mass fervour of democratization that followed it. Perhaps, even under the monarchy, that spirit could be recreated, nurtured into action through Izquierda Espanola’s policies, and Spain could make the best out of the current situation. Perhaps, the true spirit of 1931 was not completely lost, but simply forgotten, waiting to be discovered once more. Azaña sighed and turned back to head into the current session of the Cortes, feeling somewhat revitalized. Spain would know progress, even under the king, if Azaña could help it."

However, the long years under the military iron boot have made Spaniards more understanding of our good message, and the Spain of today has, in many ways, begun resembling some of the ideals the old Republic could not achieve. The bloated officer corps of the army, prone to corruption, nepotism and conspiratorial reactionarism, has been purged and finally set to a course of a proper modern military, not a semi-feudal clique of rivaling knighthoods, each seeking to beat the other for monetary and political gain. The tyrant Sanjurjo has been judged before the law, and his allies in the military have not escaped our wrath. The party has evolved from a group of, at times elitist and insulated, liberals to a party of true popular action, emphasizing the active role of enlightened civilians who feel their patriotic duty both in their national service and civilian lives. While much is still left to be done for Spain to be truly free from the ever-present reactionary obscurants, the torch of liberty has been lit, and even a victory of the right-wing demagogues will not extinguish it ever again!"

 sprd.170.d:0 "Spanish Republic may now just be a distant memory, but many within Union Espanola still remember the glory days of Republican unity. As years have gone by, Republican parties have evolved into different directions, with Derecha Liberal drifting towards progressive conservatism with a monarchist stint, our original allies in Partido Radical wallowing in their corruption and ideological ambiguity, and our old friends in Izquierda Republicana becoming increasingly left-wing in their rhetoric and policies.\n\nHowever, despite all the changes, the parties still contain elements of the republican spirit, and if we are to defend the newfound democracy, we could attempt to form a wide-spread coalition with the former republicans to stop the socialists and monarchists from getting any ideas. After all, even during the days of the Republic, Union Republicana was always a negotiator between the various republican parties, so perhaps the new Union Espanola can continue this legacy. Initial proposals of this idea have already gathered some positive reactions from the parties, but the question remains whether to include Partido Radical given the history between our party and Lerrouxists."

However, while the forming of this alliance was attempted, the loss of Britain and the rising authoritarianism of National French State, German Empire and various other major powers, as well as the spiral towards collapse that engulfed United States, made any plans to form a liberal internationale mere fantasy. \n\nHowever, given our increased reliance on the myth of Jacobinism and the lack of democratic radical beacons in the world, many with Union Espanola have raised the matter of perhaps forming one ourselves. After all, the fall of France and the weakness of remaining French radicals does put us as one of the strongest radical parties left in the world, but there are still many around the globe who support the ideals of the original Jacobinism. The time looks ripe for the rebirth of the Radical Entente, to fully align the world’s radicals under one banner and resist the vile autocratic monarchs and devious syndicalists.  Some critics of the idea have claimed that the proclamation of this alliance will just cause the Communards to invade us, though whether France has the means to do so in the current international situation remains questionable."

 sprd.172.d:0 "So far, we have had to walk the tightrope when it came to our policy with the church. After all, policy towards the church galvanized many of the original supporters of Sanjurjada to act, and zealots such as Carlists, Integrists and other religious fundamentalists have long been enemies of democracy and people’s will in Spain. Now, however, Spanish democracy has existed for a long time, and our support has grown to the point that we may finally be able to finish off the relic holding us in the past. Martinez Barrio has announced the reinstitution of the Republican secular laws.\n\nThe Catholic Church will be barred from holding any stakes in industry or commerce, the state subsidies to clergy will be entirely cut within two years of the law passing and any religious entities that require an oath of allegiance to any other institution than the state itself will be banned entirely from the nation. This final point would mainly target Jesuits. Further investigations into church properties will be taken, and those considered unnecessary for religious use will be nationalized so that they may be used for the benefit of society. Similarly, the state will be able to veto appointments made by the church within its organization, to curtail the appointment of anti-democratic or fundamentalist clergymen. There are some limitations to the legislation we can push through, however, as the king is obviously quite heavily connected to the church, and even though the monarchy abandoned its reactionary role in previous dictatorships, the weakening of the church role is still a sore spot for them. Still, at least the new legislation will finally kick the church out of most social functions it is not needed in."

With the last divisions between Radical Democrats and Radical Socialists fading away, we’ve made Spain into a secular, progressive paradise it was always meant to be. Centuries of meddling in this process by the church, various monarchies from Bourbons to Bonapartes, and the endless moneysinks of the colonies have held Spain from achieving its true potential as a liberal world power, but bit by bit we have pulled this nation to the level of other European countries.\n\nMartinez Barrio’s moderate rhetoric mixed in with radical action to those that deserve it has led us from victory to victory. While many challenges still remain until Spain has truly fulfílled its place in the world, thanks to our actions that day is ever closer. The Republic may be dead, and we mourn it all the same, but even despite the monarchy compromise we have achieved many of the goals that seemed impossible to reach after the collapse of the Republican dream."

While we are still weak to the point of being unable to contest the rule of the church and king completely, some members of UE have proposed strengthening our Jacobinist rhetoric. After all, over the border, the meddlesome syndicalists also claim to be heirs to Jacobinism, which we wholesale reject.\n\nFanning the Francophobia that has taken hold over Spain during the primoderiverista era, we could gain support even from our rivals and enemies as few legal parties in Spain openly support the Communard regime. This support could later earn us some goodwill as we push more radical reforms, such as the secularisation of the Spanish state. As such, while many within our party leadership are not as dedicated to nationalism as their Partido Radical counterparts, in this instance we must fully leverage the anti-French rhetoric in our manifestos and political speeches. After all, Radical parties are the true, pure heirs of Jacobinism, untainted by socialist or syndicalist ideologies."

 sprd.175.t:0 "Mending the Party Divide"
 sprd.175.d:0 "After the unification of Partido Radical Democrata and Partido Radical-Socialista in 1934, Diego Martinez Barrio and Felix Gordón Ordás have laboured to bridge the differences these two parties have had towards policy. While both parties showed a perhaps too overzealous attitude towards achieving secularization in the past, they have now been forced to shift their perspectives towards more practical fields, such as economy and agrarian reform. This has led to some friction before the former Radical-Socialists and Radical Democrats, as while the two parties share some common ideas, especially those among the ranks of the Radical-Socialists tend to veer more to the left in economic issues. As such, a party convention has been called to fully mend party divides and choose a line that our new union must follow.\n\nThe supporters of Martinez Barrio espouse the following of Radical liberalism and moderate cooperation between parties, while the followers of Gordón Ordás promote a society built on progressive values and moderation between parties, upholding democracy as the paramount value of the entire society. This line is seen as a more conservative stance on matters than their more radical opponents within the PRRS wing of UR, who instead promote the adoption of a liberal variant of socialism. Led by Álvaro de Albornoz, this wing of the former PRRS denounces Marxism, but promotes the adoption of more radical methods inside UR, borderlining on veering into Izquierda Espanola’s rhetoric at times. They are also more willing to work with left-wing parties such as PSOE.\n\nFourth option, coming out of left field for many, is the adoption of the ideology promoted by the Czech National Socialist Party. Circulo Espanol del Praga, and it’s Spanish counterpart, La Agrupacion de Amigos de Checoslovaquia,  a collection of Czech and Spanish intellectuals and notable members of their society have long been in a cultural exchange, despite the sad state of Czech independence movement. As the republican movements of Czechia and Spain had a lot in common, our radicals naturally intermingled in these sorts of organizations, and thus many within UR are aware of the style of liberal radicalism the Czechs espouse. This “National Socialism” promoted by the likes of T.G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, is not massively known in Spain, but could prove to be a good common ground to unite our fragmented party around, due to its focus on civic nationalism, moderate socialism and liberal spirit."

Both of these two groups used to be part of the larger Partido Radical Republicana, led by the infamous silver-tongued demagogue Alejandro Lerroux, and the main cause for the split was the increasing caudilloism of Lerroux and his constant compromising with the right-wing parties of Spain, especially those that were clearly very pro-church in nature. Now that Union Espanola has shown itself to be the stronger of the two radical parties of Spain, we must launch a full investigation into Lerrouxist degeneracy and corruption, just to keep them on their toes and to weaken our strongest opponent. Still, this merging of PRRS and PRD has not been easy, and while we are united in cause to decimate the Lerrouxist false radicals, the frictions inside UE are beginning to mount. In order to properly fix the damage done to radicalism by those who sought to corrupt it, UE must adopt a unified vision, and do so soon."

However, the unique nature of Spain means that UE must compromise on the centralist nature of radical liberalism if we are to avoid the ire of the minorities. After all, we participated in the Pact of San Sebastian, guaranteeing the rights of Spanish minorities with our signature. Moving to a less exclusively anti-regionalist direction would probably earn us a great deal of goodwill among the minor peoples of Spain, especially as their most popular parties in turn tend to be rather pro-Republican. This move could possibly also align the various smaller sections of Lerroux’s Radicals closer to us, making integration of these autonomous parties easier when the time comes to take action towards them. While UE will never reach as strong a stance towards minorities as the Azanistas, we will implement new policies aimed at safeguarding the autonomy and cultural priviledges of the Spanish minorities.."

 sprd.178.d:0 "Spanish political scene tends to be perceived only at the national level or through some select regionalist parties such as the Basque PNV or Catalan ERC, but especially since the abandonment of the two-party system and the proclamation of the republic, local-level parties have propped up at an incredible rate. Often these parties operate within a single territory of Spain, or at best in the surrounding provinces, but they nonetheless often wield such an influence that even state-level parties must pay heed to their demands. Partido Radical, our old rivals, have swayed two such parties to their side, these being the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista and the Granadan Partido Republicano Autónomo de Granada.\n\nö PURA represents the left flank of PR’s autonomous parties, while PRAG has long tried to position themselves further from the main party due to various internal changes of Partido Radical. While they may not see eye to eye with Union Espanola on all issues, we could seek to integrate them into our organization in the future, especially as many PURA members have already joined us in the past. Another splinter of the Lerrouxist Radicals is also the small Catalan party, Partit Radical Autònom de les Comarques Tarragonines. Due to their Catalan roots, the party has slowly drifted away from Lerrouxism and into the arms of Catalan nationalists, but thanks to our evolution into less outwardly hostile party towards the Spanish minorities, we could attempt to woo this party into joining us. However, many within our party believe that if we are to absorb these smaller regional groups, it could lead to a slide towards different ideological basis, especially with the Blasquismo of PURA."

Jesuits and monastic clergy have infiltrated our school system thoroughly, and the role of the church in education is immense, with many schools being completely under church ownership. This, simply cannot stand. Union Espanola has begun a massive operation to nationalize all Catholic school, though this is not as simple as it seems. Many of our teachers are nuns or monks, and while they cannot be blamed for the nefarious plans of the Papacy and its henchmen, they must be replaced with reliable, secular teachers.\n\n This is going to be costly, but there are ways we can cover for the costs. The moderate approach would be to slowly phase out church education as we educate new secular teachers, but this will compromise on our campaign promises and will obviously take time. The other option is to charge rent from church properties and use those funds to pay for the needed wages for teachers as well as the educational costs of training new teachers. This would likely anger the church and parties like Accion Popular, but considering our anti-clerical policies already being drafted, such as the reform to divorce laws and civil marriages, this little concession would probably not help our standing with Vatican."

Especially further right from us, some within the Accion Popular and especially among the radicals of Partido Nacionalista Español and Renovacion Espanola have protested his nomination, claiming that Spain will only relive the events of 1931-1932, with the socialists and radical liberals like Azaña seeking to dismantle Spain’s traditions and culture. They claim that the moderate stance of Alcala-Zamora only invites further radicalization, and his willingness to compromise with the left while holding conservative stances on other matters will simply lead to him becoming the Spanish Kerensky, inviting a terrible civil war because of his compromises. DLE’s supporters have struck back, claiming that it was only the compromises between republicans, socialists and even monarchists that allowed Spain to pass by the dark days of last few years, directly a result of Accion Popular’s disastrous policies. Nonetheless, even the rabid monarchist elements have a seed of truth in their ramblings, and it is true that Spanish republicans did go overboard in the fervor of liberalization in the faithful days of the Second Republic. We must learn from these mistakes and carve out a path where we can both appeal to the liberals, conservatives and moderates within our party without compromising too much with the rabid firebrands of Azanistas or Gil-Robles’ goons. DLE is the only party that can truly bring moderate progress to Spain, without the corruption of Lerrouxists or the radical ideology of the other parties. Just like Kerensky turned out to be the compromise candidate for Russia, so too shall Alcala-Zamora lead Spain into a moderate dawn, though the Spanish Kerensky shall avoid the mistakes of his namesake, and hopefully, the fate of him as well."

 sprd.181.d:0 "After our defeat in 1932 during Sanjurjada, Derecha Liberal Republicana had a crisis within its leadership as Antonio Maura’s son, Miguel Maura, led a part of the party with him to form Partido Republicano Conservador. This move was primarily fueled by Maura blaming the policies of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his close allies for destroying the republican dream by allying with socialists and liberals. Maurists instead wished to focus their efforts on the original dreams of DLR, creating a mass movement of non-confessional republicans who would ease Spaniards into the new state of things. With Spain stabilizing and DLR’s new successor, DLE, returning to conservatism with a liberal and progressive tinge, Maura has offered to rejoin our party if DLE does not continue its policy of dangerous alliances with the left. Given that Maura’s father was basically the founder of modern Spanish conservatism, having him and possibly his brother Gabriel Maura joining us instead of Accion Popular would boost DLE’s profile to previously unattainable heights. This does mean that any coalitions with Azanistas are ruled out, but we have already begun negotiations with conservative parties in the minority regions, such as Liga Regionalista in Catalonia, Irmandades da Fala in Galicia, Union Navarra in Navarre and Partido Nacionalista Vasco in Basque Country, as well as the Union Espanola of Diego Martinez Barrio, and hopefully we can form a large coalition without the need for Azaña’s support."

 sprd.182.d:0 "Derecha Liberal Republicana was always balancing between its two main factions, the liberal left and the conservative, Christian democrat right, and this struggle for control within the party eventually led to its weakened position in parliamentary politics. As we have returned to the Cortes in force, this issue of just what style of conservatism our new party should follow has been raised once more. There are multiple options to choose from, the easiest one obviously being that we could simply continue our curious mix of progressive and conservative policies, seeking to create a moderately Catholic state with wide popular support. However, if we were to lean more into the masses, we could also adopt even more populist tactics to create a truly mass party, less focused on the typical liberal businessmen and academics as we now do, replacing this side with more grassroots activity. This would likely put us at odds with the Lerrouxists and Accion Popular, who focus on workers and peasants respectively, but given the radicalism of those two parties, perhaps taking part of their voter based would be good for Spain. Alternatively, we could lean even more into the liberal side of our party, seeking to empower the business sector and political elite, while still maintaining our focus on civil liberties, societal progress and slight Christian tint.\n\n Yet the possibilities do not stop there, as we could also adopt the ideology of the newly integrated Partido Republicana Conservador, Maurism, named after their mentor Antonio Maura. This would see us abandon some of our more liberal principles and adopt some elements of protectionism, but it would nonetheless keep the party mostly progressive conservative in societal and economic matters. Finally, we could simply adopt Christian democracy wholesale, turning our movement more socially conservative. This shift would likely help us boost our numbers while hurting Accion Popular, which is always a nice bonus."

Spain has been tortured for so long that Spaniards themselves consider these constant crises normal, yet this must end. A political purge will be enacted within DLE to rid us of any possible warmongers and radicals, and after that, we must establish new legislation and juridical procedures to make persecuting violent or revolutionary political activists easier.\n\n Similarly, we will use one of our best contacts in the military, Major General Carlos Blanco Pérez. He happens to be a member of our party, and has provided information to us about those military officers most likely to align with both revolutionary actors aligned with the Internationale or traditionalist fundamentalists of Renovacion Espanola and the Carlists. Another military officer, general Quiepo de Llano, has also collaborated with DLE on this matter, partly because of his former republican sympathies and partly because of him being Alcala-Zamora’s son-in-law. With these two links within the army, we can finally curtail radicalism spreading within the military, and allow us to focus our energy on political and revolutionary actors who aren’t tied to it. While these actions are not particularly popular even inside DLE, they are necessary to finally exorcize the demon of political extremism that has haunted Spain for so long."

 sprd.184.d:0 "Historically, many regionalist parties have tended to align with Manuel Azaña’s Izquerdistas because of their very pro-regionalist policies, but this cooperation has very often been mired by the IE’s very radical anti-clericalism, while many large regionalist parties tend to have at least some degree of Catholic factionalism. Some, like the Basque PNV, are Christian democratic parties, who in the past supported republicans simply because of their preference for pro-autonomy policies. Now, as DLE gathers steam after the electoral victory, we could capitalize on the differences between IE and its regional allies. As DLE has leaned more into pro-Catholic policies, many local parties are seeking to align with us, but they are cautious on whether we support their calls for autonomism or prefer centralism in Spain. Centralization is preferred by many monarchists and nationalists in Spain, but it would be an understatement to say that they dislike us, so we would likely not lose much by pursuing more autonomist policies.\n\n Preliminary talks with PNV and the Catalan right-wing parties such as Liga Regionalista and Unio Democratica de Catalunya have been promising, and large Galician parties such as Dereita Galeguista and Partido Galeguista have also contacted us offering support in exchange for preferential policies. This would allow us to dislodge Azaña’s party as the leader of pro-autonomism, and given the Spanish Radical parties’ preference for centralization, they would likely not gain many votes from the minorities either. As such, the party leadership has decided to focus on legislation that would support the culture and rights of Spanish minorities, especially after so many years of oppressive military crackdowns and Castilian cultural chauvinism. Thus, these new policies are basically just one more step on our road to becoming a true mass party for all Spaniards."

However, as it currently stands, the monarchy was restored and while many within the party still hold up hopes that it could be destroyed and the monarchist flags torn down, the truth is that for the time being, the republican tricolor is not going to fly over Spain any time soon.\n\n As surprising as it may be Niceto Alcala-Zamora and other members of the party, such as Miguel Maura, used to be monarchists once. While they abandoned those convictions due to the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and the disgraceful abandonment of the Spanish people by the monarchy that happened during those years, they have now warmed up towards the monarchy thanks to the new constitutional transformation of it and renewed commitment to democracy.\n\n It is clear that DLE will most likely never match the sheer monarchist ferocity of Accion Popular or Renovacion Espanola, our monarchism will be tempered, pragmatic and most importantly, fiercely democratic, something that even the most moderate Accion Popular members could not claim in all honesty. With the DLE’s republicanism kept under a lid or possibly completely extinguished, the party will nonetheless push through the policies of the original republican dream, just fit for the new system."

In a peninsula filled to the brim with tyrants, radicals, terrorists and separatists, a seed of hope has been slowly nurtured, our moderate policies allowing it slowly recover and grow to its full potential, and now, the Spanish Kingdom stands united.\n\n The dark years, or more accurately, decades, have finally been redeemed, with the painful memories slowly fading and the scars disappearing. Without DLE’s firm but gentle hand, Spain may have very well fallen into a nosedive towards a civil war despite all the compromises and victories of 1936 and 1937. But DLE has managed to pacify those elements of the Spanish society that would not see reason, and moderate those that could. With our politics slowly but surely turning less and less polarized, Spain’s democracy may finally be allowed to thrive and grow, to reach its full potential as it was always meant to be.

As such, Spain has never truly seen a proper, democratic constitutional monarchy, where parties are free to take part in elections and compete against each other in a truly parliamentary way. Neither was there really a party calling for such a thing while also advocating for the monarchy, if we discount the accidentalist mindset of the Republic-era Spanish right. But under the transformative leadership of Niceto Alcala-Zamora and his strong allies under Miguel Maura, Spain has seen this style of governorship finally become possible, as the party expands its ranks with new, young patriots, seeking progress alongside the long traditions of the monarchy and the moderate democratic process. Thanks to our efforts, the Spanish people are getting more and more used to democracy and its characteristics, and slowly, it is developing into something that political parties across the isle see as fundamental part of our society.

As Spain develops to a shining beacon of liberal democracy in Europe, around the world’s nations this is far from the norm. The Entente is slowly slipping to autocracy, the American peoples’ are tearing each other apart, the German order is far from a paradise of democracy and the Syndicalists themselves have violently overthrown their rightful governments, and harbour dangerous radicals like Mosley, Mussolini and Valois. In Asia, Japan seeks to dominate the poor Chinese, destroying any sense of unity they could possibly achieve.\n\n Bleakness of today’s world is on a level that is completely unacceptable to DLE’s leadership, and while far from the most jingoistic Spaniards, our party leadership understands that Spain must serve its role in the liberation of the world from the shackles of tyranny, be it reactionary or revolutionary. While we prepare the Spanish nation to take a more active part in this fight for freedom, liberty and democracy, we must create the means to defend Spain’s borders from any incoming force. Extensive fortifications will be constructed in the Basque country and Catalonian border with France, and reserve units will be circulated along the Spanish coast in preparation for a naval invasion.\n\n The Spanish people must stand ready to face the storms of the world, for the protection of liberty and our free system is of utmost importance. Factories like Star, Llama and Oviedo Mauser plants will be churning out guns, ammunition and other military equipment for domestic use, but we will also create a program aimed at supplying friendly regimes in their conflicts, for if they fall, our fall will be more likely as well. And finally, a clandestine group of volunteers and military experts will be assembled to provide direct intervention forces, mostly working without national symbols, to help our allies overseas against dictators and power-hungry madmen.

Yet, we have been more successful at promoting truly democratic monarchism to the masses, as AP’s actions during the dictatorship showed their true colours to many Spanish right-wing monarchists. This has driven many minor parties, such as the agrarian parties Unión Castellana Agraria, Acción Agraria Riojana, the more traditionalist yet somewhat progressive Dereita Galeguista and Unión Navarra and the numerous smaller liberal centrist parties, such as Partido Republicano Liberal Demócrata, Partido Republicano Autónomo Navarro and Partido del Centro Democrático, into seeking an alliance or perhaps outright integration into our party. While this could help bolster out ranks and allow us to more easily defeat Accion Popular on the battlefield of parliamentarism, it would also cause our party to be ripped into different directions without considerable reorganization. As such, while many see integration of these parties as the utmost task of DLE at the moment, yet others, Miguel Maura among them, urge for caution.

Spanish culture, economy and academia blossoms as the violence of the last few years fades away, and for the first time in ages, the atmosphere of fear has vanished, replaced by a sense of pride and hope for the future, of a Spain made anew by the actions of responsible governance. While the current world order fluctuates, Spain must find its own place among it, but for now, we stand ready for the challenges the global politics will throw our way. Spain is united, moderate and stable, and for now, DLE can enjoy its place at the forefront of this change. However, as our party has continued to evolve, many have accused us of harbouring elitist sentiments, not helped by the rather laissez-faire outlook on economics that many within DLE hold. As the party attracts new blood into its ranks, many within the press and academic field have observed that DLE has slowly started shedding some of the more elitist members, both due to natural progression and partially as a concentrated appeal from DLE leadership.

While the old king recovered from his coma, he was wise enough to not contest the rule of his son, who has proven to be far more adept at seeing things as they are. As the current monarch is less blind to the issues of average Spaniards, or at the very least is attempting to care about them, DLE has decided to support the royal house fully, though less fervently as our rivals in the Accion Popular or Partido Nacional Espanola. Just as the monarchy still has long ways to go before the average Spaniards starts viewing them with less contempt, so does DLE have to go through quite a bit of internal restructuring to adjust to this new pro-monarchy stance, even when it comes to old monarchists like Niceto Alcala-Zamora. Nonetheless, should the monarchy receive the support of a former republican party, it would likely heighten its changes at being recognized as legitimate in the eyes of Spain’s people, though even then we must understand that the process of reconciliation will take time, and the republican flame may never be truly extinguished.

Already, Spaniards are becoming more charitable and caring for those in need, abandoning the greed of unfettered capitalism and the false promises of syndicalism and finding the true path to good life in God and service to Spain’s eternal institutions. While Accion Popular must continue its progress of adjusting to the new and developing Spain, we have proven that Spain, eternal Espana, still has quite a bit of fight left in her, and while the days of the Empire have long passed, through Accion Popular’s actions, perhaps she can rise to new heights once more.

However, now that we have returned to the political scene, radicalized by the slow progress of reforms, overt political Catholicism of the military regime and the presence of our old monarchist rivals on the Spanish throne once more, PR must take a swift policy shift towards these monarchists. We cannot tolerate monarchist sympathies that would draw us closer to Accion Popular, because to associate with that party would be associating with those that ruined the Republic.\n\n Instead, those monarchists that insist on remaining in our party, such as the prominent Restoration era politician Santiago Alba, must be converted to be true Radicals. Partido Radical must not slip back to its complacent moderate position, we are a party of action first and foremost and to slowly drift towards monarchism would be the death knell to our party. The monarchists of PR will accept our new political positions or leave, probably to join the DLE or the cursed Accion Popular, yet to get rid of these wolves in sheep’s clothing will only strengthen our party.

Few parties in Spain have been so rife with corruption, grift and embezzlement as Partido Radical, and scandals such as the Straperlo affair of 1934, where the nephew of Alejandro Lerroux was caught trying to influence Accion Popular politicians to accept the legalization of fixed roulette. Accion Popular used this affair as a way to blackmail Radicals and republicans in general, and the fallout left Partido Radical reeling for quite some time. While it did enact a small purge within the party, the rate of corruption within PR is incredibly difficult to fully root out, and many of our senior politicians, such as Rafael Salazar Alonso and Moreno Calvo, have been implicated in many corruption and bribery cases.\n\n The party leader Alejandro Lerroux has managed to remain free of these scandals thus far, but his shady dealings in ruling his personal fiefdom, the street of Paraleo in Barcelona, a notable hive of scum and villainy, have made him very suspicious to law enforcement agents, at least those not in his pocket at the moment. However, while sweeping the party clean of corrupt grifters would probably make it better at doing, well, its job as governors of the Spanish people, one could also argue that the election victory implicates that no change is needed. After all, Spanish people have lived under the corrupt military regime for almost two decades now, and while Lerroux’s party has many that enjoy the finer things in life, assisted by generous ‘political interest groups’, they can’t be as ridiculously corrupt as the military, after all?\n\n However, many within Lerroux’s inner circle have argued that we must instead turn the accusations to our strength, purge the party of worst offenders and return to the golden days of the pre-Primo de Rivera era, when Lerroux was known as a firebrand populist, willing to use methods other parties didn’t have the guts to, bringing radical change to Spain even if it meant taking or giving a few bribes here and there to achieve."

This has obviously greatly weakened our party in the short term, but in the long term the damage done to PR’s reputation may finally be repaired and our pride restored. However, now that we have stripped the party from many of its most prominent members, the question remains, where do we go from here? Obvious answer would be a return to radical liberalism, allowing us to perhaps integrate Diego Martinez-Barrio’s Union Espanola in the future, but many also view this as too similar to them in case they want to retain the parties as separate entities, and thus it would likely lead us to bleeding voters to UE in the future as well. Others have instead argued that we should adopt the ideology of our smaller regional party,  the Valencian Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista. PURA was, at its infancy, dominated by one man, Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, whose ideology was in broad strokes similar to that of Partido Radical, but in reality much more in touch with the local population, and some would argue, more linked to regionalism. However, this is not the case, as while the party maintains a very Valencian nature, they still promote Spanish nationalism same as PR, and fight back against Catalan separatism. The party is noted for its heavy use of grassroots populism, and at times, direct political action even in the form of violence to achieve its goals. This could give us a truly reinvigorating perspective into governance. But these are not the only options. Others yet have argued that we should retain some elements of our former moderate outlook during the  Republican years, and instead lean more towards Classical liberal ideals, to appease the growing middle-class support of PR over our working-class supporters in Barcelona.

This would greatly help with colonial affairs and future colonial projects should we hope to advance further into Central Africa in the inevitable case of German colonial collapse. However, although the project is paid for, there is a matter of Antonio Nombela, who our informants claim is planning to snitch out on this project. Given that we had to grease quite a few wheels to get the West Africa Company to sign the papers, this is obviously unacceptable.\n\n As Partido Radical is looking to tap into the potential of African colonial trade, especially given the very destabilized nature of Mittelafrika’s law enforcement, we must get the trade route up and running, and having some upstart colonial enforcer stepping out of his role to snoop in the business is too risky. We could obviously just dismiss him, but other party members consider this too likely to get spotted by authorities, so there has been suggestions to fabricate an accident for the man or to implicate him for some crime that would get him locked off for some time, giving us time to pull this colonial venture through."

While in parts, this could be considered true, these insults were mostly coming from Catalan anarchists and separatists who were seeking to leave the glorious nation of Spain to form their own breakaway state, so one could claim they were not in a position to hurl such claims.\n\n However, while the term Lerrouxismo is infamous, the promises of such ideology tend to appeal to many young and radical men, especially those who live in the regions dominated by one of Spain’s many minority groups, for example the cities of Bilbao and Barcelona. These men, brought to these cities due to their growing industrial might, found themselves surrounded by foreign language, foreign culture and hostile attitudes towards Spaniards, all because these virtuous men wanted to continue working for the betterment of Spain. Lerroux provided a voice for them, denouncing the Catholic church feeding lies to them and the separatist scum looking down upon them for being loyal to the true ruler of Iberia, the Spanish state. Lerroux’s closeness to the people, easily achievable due to his control over the famous entertainment street, Paraleo of Barcelona, allowed him to use his populist rhetoric and radical ideas to reach the Spanish patriots and use them to break those who would seek to break Spain apart or to the ignorance of old, be they anarchists, socialists, separatists or church lackeys. \n\nHis violent anti-clericalism and anti-syndicalism inspired many to fight the good fight against forces hostile to Spanish nature. But throughout the years, Lerroux lost some of his fire. The republic’s initial reforms went against his beliefs, pushing him to ally right-wing parties and compromise with the Catholics. Fighting the radicalism of his fellow republicans, PRR adopted moderatism, but given that the Republican experiment was cut short by the military jackals, perhaps it’s time to light the fire of Lerrouxismo again. As we did back in 1910s, we shall act now, serving as a vanguard of modernity, its noble barbarians bringing the fight to church backwardness, socialist lies, separatist delusion and anarchist degeneracy alike.

While the dictator may have been a tyrant, at least his response to the Catalan devils was appropriate. Now, Catalan separatists once more conspire with the anarchists of CNT-FAI, and Spanish unity is at risk.\n\n Running battles between the police and emboldened Catalan separatists from Estat Catala, Nosaltras Sols and Joventuts d'Esquerra Republicana-Estat Català are almost daily occurrences, and Guardia Civil is working overtime in pursuing leads about suspected separatist holdouts. More muscle is needed to bring this insidious movement down, and the history of Partido Radical may have the answer ready. Back in the end of 1910s, Lerrouxist republicans participated in an organization called Liga Patriótica Española, an ad hoc organization consisting of Carlist workers, police and military men, Mellistas and even football hooligans from the club Real Club Deportivo Espanyol de Barcelona. These mixed units faced down Catalan nationalists on the streets, battering sense into their stubborn heads.

While these concessions will not be the regionalist-loving softness of Izquierda Espanola or the moderate regionalism of Union Espanola, they will nonetheless be a massive policy shift for Partido Radical, and one we must recover from in other areas to avoid total party collapse."

A true source of power for Lerroux has almost always been his knowledge of connecting with the working man, which has allowed him to exploit the fears and dreams of the common man to achieve enough political capital for his political goals. His connection to the average Spaniards was partially due to his control over the street of Paralelo, one of the main streets of Barcelona known for its theatres, cabarets and circuses.\n\n The significance of Paralelo is immense, as the street rivals many of the famous entertainment centres of the world, such as London’s West End, New York’s Broadway and Paris’ Montmartre, housing such renowned venues such as El Molino concert hall, Teatro-Circo Olympia circus and Talía Theatre. The street may be a source of great art, but it is also rife with drug use, prostitution and organized crime, leading it to have a very two-faced appearance. This duality, however, has allowed Lerroux to connect with elites and workers alike, as his grip on the street has been absolute until the Catalans drove him out temporarily, but he returned in force and his political machine became synonymous with the night-life of Paralelo, granting him the nickname ‘Emperor of Paralelo’.\n\n Now, the Emperor of Paralelo labours under the Spanish king, but he has not forgotten his roots in the dirt of that Catalan street, and as Lerroux continues his crackdown on Catalan separatism, Paralelo serves as his castle to rule the realm of Barcelona from, the Emperor’s agents hunting down separatists and anarchists alike."

In the speech, he addressed many young radicals, committed anti-clericals and fierce streetfighters, saying:\n\n ‘Young barbarians of today: enter and sack the decadent civilization of this unhappy country, destroy its temples, finish off its gods, tear the veil from its novices and raise them up to be mothers to virilize the species, break into the records of property and make bonfires of its papers that fire may purify the infamous social organization. Enter its humble hearths and raise the legions of proletarians that the world may tremble before their awakened judges. Do not be stopped by altars nor by tombs. Fight, kill, die’\n\n The announcement was followed by hysterical action in the crowd, as they were caught in the fervour of the speech, but for the rest of Spain’s political scene, the announcement was met with mixed reactions. Accion Popular, Partido Nacional Espanola and Derecha Liberal Republicana denounced such violent demagoguery and claimed that Lerroux would only push Spain back to the chaos of the last decade once more.

However, the party’s small but influential monarchist wing, still around despite the crackdown earlier in PR’s history, has argued that brokering a power-sharing deal with the king could be beneficial for Lerrouxists as it would end the needless stalemate that continues to harm PR’s image and prevents alliances with moderate monarchists such as the members of DLE. However, thus far Lerroux has brushed such ideas aside, claiming that as long as he draws breath, Radical party shall remember the crimes the monarchists committed on the republic.

 sprd.284.d:0 "A new reactionary force has risen to the political scene of Spain, as Partido Nacionalista Espanol has taken the stage. Representing far-right mixture of non-Carlist traditionalists, legionaries, former Maurists and some militant agrarians, the party is kept together under the watchful eye of Dr. José María Albiñana, an eccentric figure whose Legionaries of Spain have been known to rough up political opponents, republicans and socialists alike. Hardly anyone saw these ruffians attempting to move to parliamentary politics, but Albiñana has announced his bid to run in the upcoming elections on a platform of bringing back a sense of pride to Spain and putting to sword those who would slander the great nation. Focusing mainly on rural farmers and Catholic workers, PNE seeks to offer an alternative to the radical anti-democratic monarchists of Renovacion Espanola and the more moderate king’s favourites in Accion Popular. Few in Spain expect PNE to be able to moderate its course, and even fewer expect them to win in the elections, but the political landscape of Spain has certainly shifted into an interesting direction."

 sprd.1101.d:0 "Spain was, regrettably, slow to capitalize on the possibilities offered by the African colonies, and thus the empire only gained some territories in Maghreb and the wayward colony of Equatorial Guinea. When we acquired this small colonial holding from the Portuguese in 1778 as part of the First Treaty of San Ildefonso, many expected Spain to expand further inland, using the small outpost as a launching platform into the heart of the Dark Continent. Yet the long distance to mainland Spain, rough conditions at the area, low number of settlers and the preference of Maghreb as the better colonial holding led to the neglect of Equatorial Guinea and through this, wider Spanish colonies in central Africa. However, some still dreamed of a true Spanish colony in Gabon and Cameroon, though the last of these hopes were shattered when the colonial colossus of Mittelafrika was formed. But now, this gigantic behemoth is at the brink of shattering, and the storm clouds gather in Europe, causing Germany to loosen its greedy grip on the colonies. Perhaps, the time has come to strike, and claim what we once could have had."

According to the messenger, Spain has now stabilized from its many woes during the last years, and while our Bourbon cousins there apologize for the lack of support they have provided in the last years, they have now come to us with an offer. With Spain back to its strength and united behind the crown once more, the Spanish Bourbons offer us to join them in dual monarchy, bringing the Bourbons of Spain under one banner once more. Two Sicilies would still keep its local customs, laws and institutions, and Ferdinando III would remain her king, but the two crowns would collaborate on economic, military and foreign policy matters and the empire would share its resources, men and battles equally. This union would provide us a great deal of protection in these trying times, but it would also compromise our independence."

But now, the Americans are tearing one another apart in a horrifying civil conflict, and their imperial holdings in the Pacific and Caribbean are vulnerable, left derelict in the wake of the American collapse. With Spain recovering from the years of strife, many look east, towards the old Spanish East Indies, and many within our nation have begun raising the question: ‘has the time come to reclaim what is rightfully ours?’. They are opposed by the liberals and socialists for the most part, seeing the distance between Spain and Philippines as insurmountable obstacle and the creation of yet another colony as morally abhorrent. Yet even among the liberals there are those hawkish individuals who see the lost colony as a stepping stone to recovering Spain’s lost imperial pride. While there are massive logistical challenges ahead of us if we embark on this reclamation, the will to do so seems to be there to overcome them and reclaim the isles."

 sprd.1108.d:0 "Few losses humbled Spain as much as the loss of Cuba, as the loss of our Caribbean holdings truly caused the sun to set on the Spanish empire. It had been in decline for centuries, but what little imperial glory had remained vanished as Cuba was pried from our grasp and left to the mercy of American domination. But as America spirals into chaos and destroys itself, Cuba is once more adrift, left barely over the water after American capital and industry packs its bags and heads back to the maelstrom that is the American civil war. These news have taken the intellectual and militarist circles of Madrid by storm, and a wave of imperialist fury has caused Spaniards to appeal to the crown and current government to cross the Atlantic Ocean and strike Havana, reclaiming the jewel of the Caribbean and restoring the pride lost to the barbarous Yankees. However, the long distance to the island and the long period of independence of Cuba has enjoyed have caused this imperialist movement to garner its fair share of critics, calling the colonialist dreamers naive and chauvinistic predators. As these two groups bicker over the nobility and righteousness of this colonial venture, the government must come up with its own stance on the matter and silence one of the sides in the debate."

The original French republic may have fallen to the syndicalist menace, and the remnant regime in Algiers become merely an impotent facade of the old order, unable to reclaim even their own lands. However, with Spain’s loyal sons triumphant over the Syndicalist vandals and terrorists, we can set to work on reclaiming France’s lost colonies in Africa and Asia. As the new Franco-Spanish identity settles between our two peoples, we can give the French part of our society back their pride as we reclaim our rightful colonies and soar to ever greater heights. The pretender regimes claiming dominion over Madagascar, Indochina, Cameroon and Gabon will be swept away, and French rule reestablished once more, governed in union with the Spanish loyalists."

As Spain and France are now united under one banner, Belgium and to some extent, Netherlands have been noted as possible future conquests. Belgium, while a nation of many different language groups, has a very large French-speaking population, which has led many to argue that it should be part of France altogether, as it should have always been simply a state of France from the beginning. Similarly, many Spaniards have echoed these sentiments, claiming that Spain holds a claim on the territory given our domination of Netherlands, and through them, Belgium, earlier in our history. While these claims are far weaker than those of our French compatriots, the irredentist sentiment has found a lot of support among our more right-wing elements of government and political parties. Organizations like Renovacion Espanola or Juntas Castellanas de Actuación Hispánica have called us to launch an immediate invasion, and whatever elements of Action Francaise, that have joined our regime that is, have generally supported this attack. However, there are others who view it as pushing the new union too far, as a war right as we are integrating the former Communard lands could give enough support for the splinter remnants of the Communards to revolt and cause significant issues."

 sprd.1111.d:0 "As the Spanish nations set its sight upon the reclamation of its former colonies, many within the more radical parties have put forward rather outlandish ideas of conquest. Some firebrands with Renovacion Espanola have called for Spain to carve out its own Mittelafrika, others yet call for Spain to reclaim the South American colonies by force. Plans such as these are likely results of highly delusional minds, but as the sense of imperial grandeur begins to seep back into the minds of Spaniards, other, less diabolical, ideas have been put forward. One of these imperialist plans is the reclamation of Spanish Netherlands, an area that has not been a part of our empire since the Wars of Spanish Succession. Originally acquired by the Spanish Habsburgs after the split in the main Habsburg family in the mid 1550s, the provinces managed to slip away from Spanish grasp due to domestic weakness and exploitative neighboring powers. Many pacifist leaders, such as Julian Besteiro of PSOE and Angel Pestana of Partido Sindicalista have denounced any such ideas, but the more hawkish members of the Spanish parliament, especially among Accion Popular, Partido Nacionalista Espanola and Partido Radical have supported these ideas. While Netherlands itself is a price all of its own, situated right between the great powers of Europe and boasting a strong navy, its colonial possessions in Asia and the Americas are an even more lucrative price. Still, this venture could easily be considered ridiculous by the international audience, given that Spanish rule was highly contested by the Dutch during our almost two hundred year-long rule. Nonetheless, in this new age of imperialism, perhaps the time is ripe to revive the long-lost province of Spanish Habsburgs."

 sprd.1112.d:0 "Spanish interest in the Apennines is nothing new, and for centuries we held various tributaries, protectorates and proxy states on the peninsula. Last of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, headed by a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, known commonly as the Bourbon-Two Sicilies. This realm was lost during the Italian unification, but the troubles after the Weltkrieg led into the dissolution of Italian unity and the establishment of various splinter states sponsored by the dominant powers of Europe. One of these was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, reborn as a ad hoc solution to the problem of Italian socialists gaining power. While Ferdinando III, the new king, only reluctantly accepted the position as a temporary solution, in these last two decades, circumstances have led to the kingdom becoming a mainstay of the peninsula. The instability of Spain prevented us from offering more than moral support and officer advisors, but now that Spain is finally relatively stable, we could offer more. Many within the Bourbon noble family have proposed sending an offer of alliance or even the creation of a dual monarchy with our Sicilian brothers, but should Sicilian monarchy fall, there is always the option of simply invading and annexing the tip of the peninsula."

 sprd.1113.d:0 "The Spanish empire is dead, so much is clear. What once was has been lost into the maelstrom of time, and only our few colonies in the Atlantic and Africa remain. But despite our colonial legacy, a sense of brotherhood still remains among the various Spanish-speaking nations of the world, united by a roughly uniform language and cultural norms brought into the New World by the settlers after its discovery. While we may have our differences and grievances based on historical realities, as the memories of Spanish colonization fade among our South and Central American descendants, Spain is inching closer into the cultural sphere of these nations.\n\n The ease of communication brought about by the shared values and language has made Spanish companies easier clients than those of our German and Anglo rivals, and even in the deeply depressed state that the world has sunk into, many Spanish companies make profit selling products to our former colonies and vice versa. As such, movements promoting further unity between the world’s various Hispanic peoples have gained traction. Here is Spain, prominent Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal has suggested creating a brotherly union with our former colonies, focusing on mutual cooperation and prosperity over Spanish domination of them. These ideas are not without their supporters in the New World either, as famous writers such as Uruguayan poet Juana de Ibarbourou and Cuban anthropologist Fernando Ortiz Fernández have promoted Hispanism as an alternative to the United States promotion of Yankee-dominated Pan-Americanism. With our new transition to democratic governance and constitutionalism, many within the New World look up to us as an example of stability and liberty, and thus would most likely be open to an alliance uniting the Hispanic peoples under one common cause."

 sprd.1133.d:0 "As we have now joined a faction with Portugal, the national borders of Iberia have slowly started to dissolve since troop and economic movements are becoming commonplace. For both Portuguese and Spanish monarchists, this newfound close bond has rekindled an old idea of an Iberian union, an empire uniting both halves of the Pyrenean peninsula, in our case in a dual monarchy. This would allow us to better withstand the French threat, and given that such an union has historical basis in the former dual monarchy, Iberian Union, that existed between 1580 and 1640.

 sprd.1137.d:0 "As the Portuguese part of Iberia now stands firm as a part of the Iberian empire, a newfound sense of unity has arrived to the two peoples, so long separated by artificial differences. With Portugal and Spain now a singular entity united in cause and purpose, many citizens of these states have found it difficult to adjust to the new situation and adopt an identity that is neither Spanish nor Portuguese but Iberian. Still, a newfound sense of Iberism sweeps across the peninsula, and many new clubs, committees and parties are being set up to match the realities of this new union on all levels, be they administrative, cultural, political or just linguistic. As our cultures grow closer, the question of a proper national flag for our union has been raised. We can obviously keep the current design, uniting the colours of our two nations, but another option would be to create a wholly new design, one using the regal purple and an elaborate vine design mixed a vertical stripe of Iberia’s two halves colours. Finally, we could adopt an Austrian style flag with a double eagle to celebrate our Habsburg roots and the dual monarchy."

However, many others, especially more moderate members of the Spanish public, have urged us to set up a proper colonial administration that will handle things on a local level, without overbearing and confused Spanish middlemen causing issues there.

Curiously enough, we have been approached by the Partito Popolare Italiano in hopes of uniting our two parties, as they view our movement more worthy of their support than the somewhat radical Accion Popular. Their ideology, Popularism, is a mixture of Catholic values and Christian democrat idealism, but refined to the point where they seek to create a society of harmonious communities, where differences in cultures between groups would not be a source of friction but of strength. Popularism is notably less focused on the individual than our movement generally is, but we could utilize their connections with the Italian rural folk to forge a new pact between the Christians of our two territories."

While generally a rather Sicilian thing, its main tenet is utmost loyalty to the House of Bourbon and general hardliner monarchism, something which PNE has come to be known for quite well during its brief period as rulers of Spain.

However, curiously, as our officers have been mingling with those Nationalist French generals who weren’t too bitter about their loss to not reply to them, they came across general Charles de Gaulle, a well-known French general and a close ally of Marshall Petain. Despite his grievances against our government, he shared many of his military views with our soldiers as many of our generals had fought alongside de Gaulle in the Rif War. Eventually talks turned to politics, and the French general shared that he considered the actions of the Accion Popular government in Spain to be quite inspirational to him in some measure. \n\nMany generals, also members of Accion Popular, wanted to know why this was, and de Gaulle shared his idea of a true French state, one built upon centralization of power, strong personality cult, limited welfare statism and some degree of democracy. As the talks between Accion Popular-aligned generals and de Gaulle continued long into the night, the next day these ideas of de Gaulle were brought to the attention of some Accion Popular politicians who had been in Algiers, creating a new colonial administration. As de Gaulle’s tenets spread among the party elites, some suggested that the party leader, “el Jefe” Gil-Robles, should adopt this ‘Gaullism’ as Accion Popular’s new way of thinking. Some find this absolutely preposterous, given how the ideology has never been put into action, but others see it as a rejuvenating force in a party that has for so long been seen as a stagnating one."

This has, obviously, also reached the Spanish academia, who have intermingled with their Italian counterparts, and as many of Izquierda Espanola’s members are educated members of various schools and universities, it was inevitable that the Italians would influence our politicians. By far the strongest influence has been that of Gaetano Salvemini, whose ideology is remarkably close to that of Manuel Azaña, promoting strong, anti-clerical republicanism as a means to curtail the radicalism of left and right-wing extremists while still enacting very radical reforms that would transform Italian society to be more equal, free and fair, without the need for tyranny or ignorance. Many have seen this similarity of ideology as worthy of integrating Salvemini’s much smaller party, Partido Democratico del Lavoro, into Izquierda Espanola, but this would obviously mean adopting some of their ideological leanings as well."

As CNT-FAI resistance grew bolder, many other groups also began to harbour traitorous thoughts. The Catalans had been a thorn in our side for quite some time, but the years of pistolerismo and Spain’s defeats in Rif War made their rebellion a very possible reality in Catalonia. After Primo de Rivera’s coup d’etat succeeded, one of his very first actions was to crack down on Catalan parties and regionalist organizations, even those that had previously supported Spanish rule, such as Liga Regionalista. Basque and Galician regionalists weren’t spared either, accused of being supported by the French to stir up trouble in Spain. Ironically, this persecution of Spain’s minorities drove them to accept help from the Communards, and despite our best efforts, regionalist and separatist parties are still under suspicion of sending volunteers to train in Southern France. Regionalism, especially in relation to the deeply centralist line adopted by the military after the Sanjurjada coup, has been on the rise, and even regions with relatively docile nationalist movements, such as Andalusia and Asturias, have been boldened by the rhetoric of their Basque, Catalan and Galician comrades."

 sprd.1157.d:0 "Spanish regionalism stems from the very varied demographics of our nation, with many regions of Spain having their own cultural quirks, traditions and in the case of Basques, Catalans, Galicians and Asturians, among others, their own languages. Especially with the Basques, this difference is stark, as these hardy people have lived in the Pyrenean mountains for millenia, forming a culture and language that is in many ways, completely alien to that of other European peoples. Yet despite these marked differences, Basques are among the most devout Catholics in Iberia and have taken part in various ventures of greater Spain during the centuries, and over the last century, Spanish immigrants have seriously started to become a major demographic in the Basque territories. Similar thing has happened in Catalonia, where the industrial city of Barcelona has drawn in quite a bit of Spanish immigrants, often prompting violent clashes between Spanish and Catalan nationalists. Catalans have long considered themselves separate from Spain, and as a hive of anarchism and ultranationalism, the region continues to cause grey hairs for Spanish administrators and soldiers alike. Compared to Basques and Catalans, Galicians remain a relatively aloof people, not particularly bothered with nationalism, though as the situation in Spain deteriorates, many more have been goaded into joining various nationalist Galician parties in order to abandon the sinking ship of Castile."

Promoting regionalism, Basque nationalism and traditionalism without monarchism, the party always aimed to create a free Basque republic, Euskadi, separating from Spain fully. However, after a split in the party leadership, the traditionalists and ultranationalists began to lose ground to the more moderate, Christian democratic faction, which during the republican years ditched the traditional PNV allies, Carlists, to join the left-wing republican coalition in pursuit of autonomy for the Basque country. \n\nWhile the republic died, the party was repressed and has since radicalized to adopt more of their nationalist outlooks, recruiting militants into its mountaineering organization. Basque region also houses a considerable amount of Carlists, and their stronghold, Pamplona, has long been a hive of vipers seeking to topple the rightful rule of the Alfonsists. Basque country is mainly dominated by PNV, thought Acción Nacionalista Vasca, a more left-wing party, has recently emerged to challenge PNV’s hegemony, while still remaining just as staunchly nationalistic. Cells of the Communist Party of Euskadi also remain in the territory, supported by French Jacobins, though their relevance is thankfully small."

Catalan democratic parties, such as Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, Acció Catalana Republicana and Unión Democrática de Cataluña have also been caught promoting Catalan nationalism, and the leader of the radicalized youth section of ERC, Josep Dencàs, has even been accused of being a National Syndicalist. \n\nHowever, while the democrats are enough of a headache, they pale in comparison to the terrorists of Nosaltres Sols! and Estat Catala, two radical groups of ultranationalists engaging in political assassinations, bombings and hit and run attacks against the police. Nosaltres Sols! also contains a Sorelian wing, Moviment Nacionalista Totalitari, known for being in league with Valois and his Totalists. In addition to the ultranationalists, socialist and communist groups such as Partit Català Proletari and Unió Socialista de Catalunya have been known to organize strikes and sabotage to hamper our rule, motivated just as much by Catalan nationalism as they are by Marxist and syndicalist ideals."

 sprd.1160.d:0 "As Spain has begun to take back its rightful territory in the world, it would have been too good to be true if there had been no hitch-ups or issues. One of the simplest is the lack of funds, as colonial ventures are notoriously expensive. Now, we could of course just raise taxes or simply stop expanding, but given the recent uptick in nationalist fervour, this would likely be quite unpopular, and while the colonies are expected to be profitable, these profits will take a while to start mounting up, just as they did with our colony of Rif after we captured said territory and got its iron mines up and running. But while Rif is quite profitable thanks to its iron ore, its counterpart on the other side of Morocco proper, Rio de Oro, has not been nearly as great of a venture. In fact, back in 1898, right after our humiliating defeat at the hands of the Yanks, the crown attempted to sell it Austria, but this was blocked by the other part of Austria-Hungary’s dual monarchy, the Hungarians. Now, however, reports have come in that Austrians would be willing to renegotiate this deal, and in exchange for a foothold in Africa, they would offer us funds to fuel our colonial ventures. While this would mean giving away yet another of our few colonies, it would be given to an ally of ours and quite frankly, the territory of Rio de Oro is not that important to the Spaniards. As such, the king has approved the Austrian request, but the government must approve it as well."

 sprd.1161.d:0 "与加泰罗尼亚人和巴斯克人相比，加利西亚人至今尚未制造太多麻烦，但该地区日益高涨的民族主义仍令人不安。不同于毕尔巴鄂或巴塞罗那的工业化进程，加利西亚始终未发展成工业重镇，因此尽管该地区政治活跃，却未像巴斯克和加泰罗尼亚那样因西班牙移民涌入而激进化。不过，一小群加利西亚民族主义者——\"语言兄弟会\"开启了加利西亚主义的民族化转向，如今这一组织虽仍存在，但其领导地位已被\"加利西亚主义党\"取代。\n\n1931年共和国宣告成立时，加利西亚人甚至一度宣布成立独立的加利西亚共和国，但仅维持一天便悄然回归西班牙本土。然而，多年的政治动荡使加利西亚主义愈发激进，新党派如\"加利西亚民族主义先锋\"进一步推动极端民族主义议程。部分加利西亚主义者主张独立建国，另一些人则基于所谓\"凯尔特血统\"的论调，鼓吹与葡萄牙建立联邦。更有极端者如神秘主义者比森特·里斯科，深受奥地利\"雅利安神秘学\"等极端意识形态影响。马德里的高压镇压甚至迫使温和派转向公开对抗——例如曾在共和国时期主张西班牙联邦化的\"加利西亚地区自治组织\"。尽管加利西亚尚未成为加泰罗尼亚式的火药桶，我们仍需密切关注该地区的动向。"

 sprd.1163.d:0 "未来，这场被称为“桑胡尔霍政变”的事件很可能被视为西班牙1930年代的决定性时刻——其对国家的影响与1923年米格尔·普里莫·德里维拉发动的政变如出一辙。此次政变由国民警卫队指挥官何塞·桑胡尔霍将军领导，并得到德意志帝国及阿尔及尔的法兰西民族国的强力支持。此前，两国对西班牙共和体制的建立冷眼旁观，直至共和派与社会主义者结盟。因恐惧社会主义掌权及西班牙加入第三国际，德国皇帝国向政变策划者提供了物资与经济支援，法国势力甚至准备直接干预。随着“红色恐慌”席卷西班牙，“人民行动党”领导层——尤其是其政治新星何塞·马利亚·希尔-罗夫莱斯——与政变集团合流，连卡洛斯派也以“呼啸兵”民兵形式提供支持。\n\n尽管政变获得的军方直接支持有限，但凭借外国资金支持及流亡国王阿方索十三世的突然背书，国民警卫队以闪电速度推翻马德里政府统治。暴动随即蔓延全国，加泰罗尼亚无政府主义民兵揭竿而起，迫使原本中立的军官卷入混战。随着马德里陷落及法德两国迅速承认桑胡尔霍政权，溃散的共和派只能流亡友邦。第三国际虽一度濒临干预加泰罗尼亚，却反应迟缓，只能眼睁睁看着伊比利亚半岛的潜在盟友倒退回反动君主制。政变集团扶植“人民行动党”组建文官政府（实则受军方严密操控），并通过简短仪式将阿方索十三世重新推上王座。曾因政变期间“传统军”支持而期待军方拥护己方王位继承人的卡洛斯派，因遭背叛而愈发激进，政变前一度有望的卡洛斯派与阿方索派和解谈判再度化为泡影。"
